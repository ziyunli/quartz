[My first impressions of web3](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html) a great great read about the current state of web3 and its problems. So many takeaways:

- why centralized platforms emerged:
  - **People don’t want to run their own servers, and never will**
  - A protocol moves much more slowly than a platform

The lack of "distributedness" in the current web3:

> All the network diagrams are of servers, the trust model is between servers, everything is about servers. Blockchains are designed to be a network of peers, but not designed such that it’s really possible for your mobile device or your browser to be one of those peers.
>
> Almost all dApps use either Infura or Alchemy in order to interact with the blockchain. In fact, even when you connect a wallet like MetaMask to a dApp, and the dApp interacts with the blockchain via your wallet, MetaMask is just making calls to Infura!
