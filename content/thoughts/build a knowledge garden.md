title: Build a Knowledge Garden
---

In this version 1, the site is generated by [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), edited with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and deployed on [GitHub pages](https://ziyunli.github.io/quartz/). After mucking around for an afternoon, I have established some basic rules.

I decided not to use tags extensively: Obsidian uses spaces to separate tags, while quarts renders a tag in a space-separated first-word-capitalized sequence. This gets confusing and now looking good. I also find that my previous usage of tags is not that helpful to retrieval information, and requires extra efforts to maintain. If you have a well-organized knowledge graph, what extra values that tags can provide you anyway? 

Therefore, dropping it seems to be the right move here. As some points, I might adapt [the tagging system used by the author of quarts](https://jzhao.xyz/tags/). For now, I use folders as the primary way to manage the contents:
- [TILs](/TILs) as a collection of short-form tidbits
- [notes](/notes) for longer-form notes and write-ups

All the existing contents are imported from my blog. The TIL posts seem fine to be left as-is, but the notes will require some clean-up.
