Since I started playing [soccer](../../writing/Soccer.md), I’ve gradually built up a collection of football boots. Early on, I made quite a few missteps, which led me to learn more about boot differences—and that’s how my collection began.

| **TF**     | Nike Mercurial Vapor 15 Club Turf       | ★★☆    | [[20230821]]: $59.99 <br>**No Longer Owned**                                                 | This was my first pair when Jasper wanted to play daily. The size 9 was too small, and the TF studs performed poorly on natural grass. They were mediocre in quality, but I have fond memories of them.                                                                                                     | ![](../assets/nike-mercurial-vapor-15-club-tf.png)    |
| **TF**     | adidas X Crazyfast.3 Turf               | ★★☆    | [[20240111]]: $71.25                                                                         | Size 9.5 is too narrow and hard to put on. The stiff, thin upper lacks padding, and I didn’t feel enough grip from the plastic-like material. That might be because I played on AG at night and the ball got slippery with dew.                                                                             | ![](../assets/adidas-x-crazyfast-3-tf.png)            |
| **TF**     | New Balance Furon v7 Dispatch TF Wide   | ★★★☆   | [[20240319]]: $32.39                                                                         | My first New Balance boots. The wide fit suits broad feet well, and the comfortable padding is a big step up from my previous pairs. I didn’t realize back then that TF boots wouldn’t provide enough traction on AG surfaces.                                                                              | ![](../assets/new-balance-furon-v7-dispatch-tf.png)   |
| **Indoor** | Nike Streetgato                         | ★★☆    | [[20240406]]: $74.97                                                                         | My most-worn pair this year. They look like casual sneakers, and I often wore them to Jasper’s training sessions to get a few touches on the side. However, they can be slippery on wet surfaces, so I’m not sure how they’d perform on a true indoor court. Overall, they’re a convenient everyday option. | ![](../assets/nike-streetgato.png)                    |
| **Indoor** | adidas Copa Gloro (Indoor)              |        | [[20241027]]: $34.48                                                                         | —                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | ![](../assets/adidas-copa-gloro-indoor.png)           |
| **FG**     | Lotto Stadio 200 III FG                 | ★★     | [[20241027]]: $19.48                                                                         | Easy to slip on for wide feet, but the heel lockdown is poor. The heel studs are especially long and bulky on AG, and the tongue flaps around during play. I should’ve returned them despite the low price.                                                                                                 | ![](../assets/lotto-stadio-200-iii-fg.png)            |
| **FG**     | New Balance 442 v2 Pro FG Wide          | ★★★☆   | ~~[20241209](../journals/20241209.md): \$71.78~~ **Returned**<br>[[20241218]]: \$62.41 + tax | Comfortable and lightweight, with conical FG studs that work well on AG. The heel lockdown is weak but improves with a runner’s loop. They have limited water resistance, making them less ideal in heavy rain, and the studs get very slippery on wet surfaces.                                            | ![](../assets/new-balance-442-v2-pro-fg.png)          |

I’m looking forward to trying them out.                                                                                                     | ![](../assets/nike-premier-3-k-leather.png)           |

I went with EU 43/UK 9, hoping for a better fit.                                                                                                                                                                                              | ![](../assets/mizuno-morelia-neo-4-beta-elite.png)    |
| **FG**     | New Balance Tekela Pro V4+ Low          |        | [20241228](../journals/20241228.md): $88.58 + tax                                            | I returned a second pair of 442s and picked these up instead after hearing great things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ![](../assets/new-balance-tekela-pro-v4+.png)         |

They’re decently soft and padded for a takedown model, with studs that feel good on AG and hold up well in the rain. Despite being cheaper than my later pairs, they’ve really grown on me.                                                                                   | ![](../assets/nike-phantom-gx-academy.png)            |

They were painful for wide feet, and the thin “barefoot” upper isn’t my style. I missed the return window.                                                                                                   | ![](../assets/mizuno-alpha-elite-ag-mugen-blue.png)   |

I haven’t worn them yet because I’m currently using the Phantom Luna 2 Elites.                                                                                                                                                                        | ![](../assets/nike-phantom-gx-2-elite-ag.png)         |

They’re my current favorites.                                                                                           | ![](../assets/nike-phantom-luna-2-elite-ag.png)       |
