The site is generated by [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), edited with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and deployed on [GitHub pages](https://ziyunli.github.io/quartz/). Some basic rules I am trying to stick to when organizing my learning and knowledge:

1. Here is to keep track of notes and summaries from books and articles.
   1. Most of the notes are private by default.
   2. Some polished and cleaned up notes will eventually promote to the public.
2. I use [Readwise](https://readwise.io/@ziyun) to manage highlights from books and articles, but I try to make as few as possible now. Ideally, they should be wisdom that can
   1. withstand the test of time, and
   2. does _not_ require a lot of context to understand.
3. I also use [Readwise Reader](https://read.readwise.io/) to maintain a to-read list, but again, I try to make it as short as possible just so that I can actually allocate time to read them.
4. Minimal usage of tags
   1. Quarts renders a tag in a space-separated first-word-capitalized sequence, which sometimes confuses me.
   2. I also find that my previous usage of tags is not that helpful to retrieval information, and requires extra efforts to maintain.
5. For now, everything goes into [notes](/notes).
