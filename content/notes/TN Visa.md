## Change or Addition of Employers

There are two ways for an individual in TN status to change employers or obtain authorization for a concurrent position:
* through the employer filing a petition with the USCIS, or
* by returning abroad and applying on re-entry.

## Termination of Employment

Upon termination of employment (whether voluntary or involuntary), the TN professional may remain in the U.S. for **up to 60 days**, or until the end of his authorized period of stay, whichever is shorter). There is no requirement for the employer to pay transportation costs. **If the TN finds a new job, he must recommence the applicable TN process from the beginning.**
