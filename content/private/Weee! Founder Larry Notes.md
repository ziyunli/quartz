- Product-Market Fit: Asian community is terribly underserved
	- Existing offline grocery chains are dated and boring to shop from
	- Sizable market: Ranch 99 and HMart each is about $1B in sales
- Merchandising is important
	- Currently 2000 SKUs
	- Their own warehouse in Union City
	- Finding products that are interesting/exciting/delicious → the products themselves drive growth
		- E.g. Peony Grapes - best-selling items (when they are in stock)
- How to build merchandising capability
	- Started building this capability very early on; one of the largest team
	- Took them 2 years to get to 2000 SKUs
	- US supply chain is fairly efficient
	- They built the reputation of being able to put products online and start selling quickly
- How to do deliveries
	- Orders are taken the night before
	- Drivers take packaged orders from warehouse and put them in minivans
	- 40 addresses to deliver per trip
	- On average, 10 addresses per hour, get paid $200 in an afternoon
- Growth
	- Best experiment
		- Social sharing on WeChat + everyone sees it can help the sharer get discount on the order + time-limited coupon for the same product for people see the sharing
			- Repeat sharing
			- Authentic recommendation
			- 3X weekly orders?/activations?
	- Running many experiments at the same time
		- Tries to have a philosophy behind every new feature
			- E.g. limit quantity flash sales start at 11pm → introduce price discrimination to capture more users/orders
