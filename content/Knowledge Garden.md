The site is generated by [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), edited with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and deployed on [GitHub pages](https://ziyunli.github.io/quartz/). Some basic rules I am trying to stick to when organizing my learning and knowledge.

1. Here is to keep track of notes and summaries from books and articles.
   1. LLMs (mostly Claude Code, but will experiement with OpenAI Codex and Google Gemini later) will be used
   2. LLMs are used to organize the content as well as serve as a personal assistant and information retrieval tool.
2. I use [Readwise](https://readwise.io/@ziyun) to manage highlights from books and articles, but I try to make as few as possible now. Ideally, they should be wisdom that can
   1. withstand the test of time, and
   2. does _not_ require a lot of context to understand.
   3. either quotes or individual files with a tag `do-not-edit`.
4. Minimal usage of tags
   1. Quarts renders a tag in a space-separated first-word-capitalized sequence, which sometimes confuses me.
   2. I also find that my previous usage of tags is not that helpful to retrieval information, and requires extra efforts to maintain.
   3. LLMs are used to generate tags for me.
   4. Tags are used to categorize content and make it easier to find.
