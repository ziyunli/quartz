You always scale up to some users, up to some architecture, up to some amount of nodes. There is no system that will scale to infinity without requiring developer intervention once business needs and application patterns start to settle in.\n\u003e \n\u003e Distributed Erlang/Elixir _has known limitations_. For example, the network is fully meshed, which gives you about 60 to 200 nodes in a cluster. Or don't send large data over distribution, as that delays the other messages, etc. Some of those are easily solvable. For example, you can rely on your orchestration tools to break your clusters in groups. Or you can setup an out of band tcp/udp socket for large data. Others may be more complex.\n\u003e \n\u003e The important question, however, is how far you can go without having to tweak, and, once you reach those roadblocks, how well you can address them. In many platforms, writing a distributed system is a no-no or, at best, they require you to assemble and tweak from day one. In this case, the ability to start with Erlang/Elixir and tweak as you grow _is a feature_.\n\u003e \n\u003e And if you never run into those roadblocks, then you can happily continue running on the default stack.

Or facilitating others to go and do what they wanted (in this case, chase a wild dream).\n\u003e \n\u003e Uber, the example you used, sells shovels. It lets people make money from their car. Real money. Not peanuts. Your idea to sell food to neighbors didn't have the potential to make much money. You weren't selling shovels, you were selling work (cooking is hard work).\n\u003e \n\u003e Now, let's take your current business (which you list in your profile). You sell shovels because you help companies get what they what in terms of engineering management (lots of money to be made there). Better engineering processes usually trickles down into the finances. In a way, you are selling money.\n\u003e \n\u003e They are middlemen.\n\u003e \n\u003e A middleman is someone who simply takes a cut for facilitating something. They import beer from somewhere else and by doing that they jack up the price a little bit and resell it to you. This is a very straightforward mechanic.\n\u003e \n\u003e Amazon is one of the best middlemen out there right now. It even changed the game by reducing the friction in selling online. Their whole \"fulfilled by Amazon\" approach is a classic middlemen tactic.\n\u003e \n\u003e Middlemen sell the idea that they make getting what you want easier.\n\u003e \n\u003e How to apply this to software\n\u003e \n\u003e Selling shovels: Build a product that makes people money. Ecommerce is still growing. Do something there.\n\u003e \n\u003e Be a middleman: Find something to facilitate. Look for inefficiencies. How? Listen to complaints. People love to complain to someone who listens. Make some contacts on social media and listen to people. They will show you the way.\n\u003e \n\u003e One last thing: don't be stupid. Big ideas are tied to a big ego. You are not Musk, Jobs, or Gates. Who cares?! Look for small ideas that you can execute well. And then execute, not for passion or ego, but as a grind. Like a regular job. Because that's what it is.

The tutorial talks about the concept and the different models, which would have saved me a lot of time later.\n\nFinally, we have everything ready for the QR code generation. The requirements for the QR code are quite interesting:\n\n\u003e - Use a high fault tolerance setting (30%).\n\u003e - Have a white margin around the QR Code (the quiet zone).\n\u003e - Use the most basic square fill with a black-and-white pattern.\n\u003e - Avoid using generators that introduce a thin white line between black elements.\n\nFrom [another article](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/redditor-creates-working-anime-qr-codes-using-stable-diffusion/), it seems to leverage the innate error correction feature so that the QR code can be distorted to fit the generated image while still being readable.\nHowever, even with a high fault tolerance setting, the generated QR code is still a hit or miss.\n\nAnd here comes my second noob mistake... I totally didn't keep track of the parameters for each generation! Fortunately, A1111 has me covered: there is a \"PNG Info\" tab that can read the parameters from the generated image. Interestingly, I can't figure out how to read this information in the macOS native preview app, so I wonder if the data is stored in the PNG file in a slightly special way.\n\nNow, for example, compare these two images that are generated with the same prompt and seed.\nThe first one is (borderline) readable.\n\n\u003e ((masterpiece),(best quality),(ultra-detailed), (upper body:1.2), 1male, solo, hood up, cyborg mask, glowing eyes, facing camera, neon details, male focus, cloak, spaceship, lightning, ultra realistic details, portrait, global illumination, shadows, octane render, 8k, ultra sharp,intricate, ornaments detailed, cold colors, metal, egypician detail, highly intricate details, realistic light, trending on cgsociety, time travel, break mirror\n\u003e\n\u003e Negative prompt: ugly, disfigured, low quality, blurry, nsfw\n\u003e\n\u003e Steps: 50, Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras, CFG scale: 7, Seed: 3502696068, Size: 768x768, Model hash: e3edb8a26f, Model: ghostmix_v20Bakedvae, Denoising strength: 0.75, ControlNet: \"preprocessor: tile_resample, model: control_v11f1e_sd15_tile [a371b31b], weight: 1, starting/ending: (0.23, 0.7), resize mode: Crop and Resize, pixel perfect: False, control mode: Balanced, preprocessor params: (-1, 1, -1)\", Version: v1.3.2\n\n![Readable](assets/qr-hit.png)\n\nBut the second one is not.\n\n\u003e ((masterpiece),(best quality),(ultra-detailed), (upper body:1.2), 1male, solo, hood up, cyborg mask, glowing eyes, facing camera, neon details, male focus, cloak, spaceship, lightning, ultra realistic details, portrait, global illumination, shadows, octane render, 8k, ultra sharp,intricate, ornaments detailed, cold colors, metal, egypician detail, highly intricate details, realistic light, trending on cgsociety, time travel, break mirror\n\u003e\n\u003e Negative prompt: ugly, disfigured, low quality, blurry, nsfw\n\u003e\n\u003e Steps: 50, Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras, CFG scale: 7, Seed: 3502696068, Size: 768x768, Model hash: e3edb8a26f, Model: ghostmix_v20Bakedvae, Denoising strength: 0.75, ControlNet: \"preprocessor: tile_resample, model: control_v11f1e_sd15_tile [a371b31b], weight: 1, starting/ending: (0.24, 0.8), resize mode: Crop and Resize, pixel perfect: False, control mode: Balanced, preprocessor params: (-1, 1, -1)\", Version: v1.3.2\n\n![Unreadable](assets/qr-miss.png)\n\nThe only difference here is the \"Ending Control Step\", from 0.7 to 0.8.\nAs in the document said: \"Decrease to stop the ControlNet earlier so that the QR code and the image can blend more naturally.\"\nYou can see that in the second QR code, the character is less distorted, but the QR code is not readable anymore.\n\nI think the same seed also generates relatively similar images. For example, the below is generated with the same seed but different prompt and input.\nYou can definitely relate to the previous two images in terms of the overall style.\n\n\u003e light, futobot, cyborg, ((masterpiece),(best quality),(ultra-detailed), (upper body:1.2), 1male, solo, hood up, upper body, mask, facing camera, male focus, cloak, spaceship, lightning, ultra realistic details, portrait, global illumination, shadows, octane render, 8k, ultra sharp,intricate, ornaments detailed, cold colors, metal, egypician detail, highly intricate details, realistic light, trending on cgsociety, neon details, time travel, broken mirror\n\u003e\n\u003e Negative prompt: ugly, disfigured, low quality, blurry\n\u003e\n\u003e Steps: 50, Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras, CFG scale: 7, Seed: 3502696068, Size: 768x768, Model hash: e3edb8a26f, Model: ghostmix_v20Bakedvae, Denoising strength: 0.75, ControlNet: \"preprocessor: depth_leres++, model: control_v11f1p_sd15_depth [cfd03158], weight: 1, starting/ending: (0, 1), resize mode: Crop and Resize, pixel perfect: False, control mode: ControlNet is more important, preprocessor params: (512, 0, 0)\", Version: v1.3.2\n\n![Same seed](assets/seed-3502696068.png)\n\nTherefore, my workflow right now is\n1. Cherry pick some keywords from some example prompts\n2. Keep hitting generate to roll the dice with -1 seed\n3. Once I see one somewhat close to the vibe I am looking for, I will fix the seed and tweak the prompt and parameters.\n\nGiven that basically I am throwing things at the wall and see what sticks, the generation speed is critical.\nUnfortunately, with M1, it's quite slow: it takes me ~3 minutes to generate one image.\nI generated ~40 images in total last night. It was a pretty boring two-hour period that I actually had to start this post...\n\nI do have a PC with a dedicated GPU sitting around, even though it's a mere 1660.\nThat's going to be my next thing to test before I opt for more powerful options (in which case, Google Colab and Paperspace would be my first choices).\n\nBy the way, I got quite lucky with my fifth image, and I am quite happy with how it looks.\nThis will be my QR code for me advertising this blog for a while.\n\n![Me time traveling from 2077](assets/me.png)","lastmodified":"2023-07-12T02:09:05.412035212Z","tags":[]},"/notes/ChatGPT-Prompt-Engineering-for-Developers":{"title":"ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers","content":"\n## Principles\n\n### Be clear and specific\n\nclear != short\n\n#### Tactics\n\n##### Use delimiters\n1.

It was used to be called \"How to Read Fast\", but then I realized that speed/volume is not what I should optimize for.  \n\nThere is another page on \n## General\n\nInstead of volume, the goal of reading should be instead comprehension. Therefore, instead of optimizing for speed, a better approach should be actively engaged during the reading[^3]\n\n\u003e What matters is how it changes your thinking and what you take away from it. Optimize for comprehension, not volume.\n\u003e \n\u003e If your goal is to maximize comprehension, you need to ask questions while you read — questions that you yourself must try to answer in the course of reading.\n\u003e \n\u003e ... \n\u003e \n\u003e This is the template I use:\n\u003e 1. In 1-2 sentences, what is the book about as a whole?\u003e     \n\u003e 2. What are the 3-4 central questions it tries to answer?\n\u003e 3. Summarize the answers in one paragraph each.\n\u003e 4. What are the most important things you have learned personally?\n\nFollowing the above process does mean the reading speed would be slower, and therefore you would need to be more picky on your book selection. It is suggested to use topical reading and inspectional reading to gather a list of books and quickly skim through them before spending more time to read into details. This approach is discussed in [如何阅读一本书](notes/如何阅读一本书.md). \n\n## Non-fiction\n\nIt turns out that I need to find a more efficient way to read so that I can get through my [Reading list](📚%20books.md). Fortunately, I have found some tips for non-fiction[^1]:\n\n\u003e [!cite]\n\u003e  \n\u003e 1. **Start with the author**. Who wrote the book? Read his or her bio. If you can find a brief interview or article online about the author, read that quickly. It will give you a sense of the person’s bias and perspective. \n\u003e 2. **Read the title, the subtitle, the front flap, and the table of contents.** What’s the big-picture argument of the book? How is that argument laid out? By now, you could probably describe the main idea of the book to someone who hasn’t read it. \n\u003e 3. **Read the introduction and the conclusion.** The author makes their case in the opening and closing argument of the book. Read these two sections word for word but quickly. You already have a general sense of where the author is going, and these sections will tell you how they plan to get there (introduction) and what they hope you got out of it (conclusion). \n\u003e 4. **Read/skim each chapter.** Read the title and anywhere from the first few paragraphs to the first few pages of the chapter to figure out how the author is using this chapter and where it fits into the argument of the book. Then skim through the headings and subheadings (if there are any) to get a feel for the flow. Read the first sentence of each paragraph and the last. If you get the meaning, move on. Otherwise, you may want to read the whole paragraph. Once you’ve gotten an understanding of the chapter, you may be able to skim over whole pages, as the argument may be clear to you and also may repeat itself. \n\u003e 5. **End with the table of contents again.** Once you’ve finished the book, return to the table of contents and summarize it in your head. Take a few moments to relive the flow of the book, the arguments you considered, the stories you remember, the journey you went on with the author.\n\nThe idea is that most of the non-fiction books is to make a point and ask us to learn from it. Therefore, you don't have to read word-for-word, but instead just need to *understand* them. \n\nThough it sounds like for fiction books, we should still read word-for-word. \n\n\u003e [!cite] Fiction demands that we enter a world of the author’s making, inspiring a more immersive experience.[^1]\n\n\n### Three Kinds of Non-fiction\n\nThe tips can be further developed to group non-fiction into three categorizes[^2]:\n- 💁‍♀️ narrative: books that tell a story, e.g. biographies, memoirs, and histories.\n- 🌳 tree: books that lay out a framework of ideas, e.g. Daniel Kahneman's _[Thinking: Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555)_, _[High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884)_ by Andy Grove, and _[Principles](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio/dp/1501124021)_ by Ray Dalio.\n- 🌿 branch: books that consist of a single idea and padded out with examples, extrapolations, and implications of that single idea, e.g. Nicholas Nassem Taleb's _[Antifragile](https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680)_.\n\nThe fore-mentioned tips are best applied to branch books, where you can skim quickly without losing much. The article in fact makes an even stronger claim that it's best to not read branch books at all and instead read a summary. \n\nFor the other two types, though, seems like we're out of luck. The article actually suggests going slow on tree books, chapter-by-chapter, to better consume and internalize. \n\n[^1]: https://hbr.org/2016/02/how-to-read-a-book-a-week \"How to Read a Book a Week\" \n[^2]: https://commoncog.com/the-3-kinds-of-non-fiction-book/ \"The three kinds of non-fiction books\"\n[^3]: https://www.andreasfragner.com/writing/writing-summaries \"Writing summaries is more important than reading more books\"","lastmodified":"2023-07-12T02:09:05.416035271Z","tags":[]},"/notes/How-to-Read-a-Paper":{"title":"How to Read a Paper","content":"\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-12T02:09:05.416035271Z","tags":[]},"/notes/How-to-Speak":{"title":"How to Speak","content":"\nNotes from watching Patrick Winston's [How To Speak by Patrick Winston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY).\nIt is recommended in [Ask HN: Best Talks of 2020?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25537230).\nIt's wonderful. While it is heavily oriented towards academia, I believe the principles are universal enough to be applied to elsewhere. Here are my main takeaways.\n\n## How to Start\n\nFirst of all, if you want to acknowledge collaborators for you projects, you should do it in the first slide. Do not end your talk with this.\nThen, you can start with an empowerment promise and set up the expectation of the audience.\nIt's also a good idea to explain how cool is the stuff, if your talk is to inform.\n\n## Heuristics for delivering the content\n\nThere are several samples to make your talk more interesting/engaging.\n\nYou should cycle on the subject, so that the audience can follow along a bit easier.\nAdding verbal punctuation is also a good idea to pace your talk. You can go through the outline at the middle of the talk, enumerate the topics you've gone through, and re-iterate how the talk has developed to. This gives the audience some breathing room to digest your talk, and provides a seam that connects all the dots.\n\nI am not sure how to interpret \"building fence around your ideas\" in a non-academic talk.\nI guess you can compare with similar projects or alternatives, and try to draw a separating lines between them.\n\nAsking a question can be a useful technique, but make sure the question is either too easy or too hard.\n\n## Tools/Time/Place\n\nIt's recommended to have your talk around 11AM in a well-lit room that ideally should be 50% occupied during your talk.\nHowever, it's usually not easy to have full control on these factors so I'd say try your best.\n\nIf possible, writing on a board is better than presenting slides via a laptop.\nA board has several useful attributes such as easy to draw graphics, appropriate speed for audience to follow, and serves as a target for your hands.\nIt also avoids many pitfalls for using a slide.\n\nIf you need to use slides, follow these guidelines:\n- Do not read\n- Be in the image\n- Keep images simple\n- Eliminate clutter\n\nYou can have a hapax legomenon once in a presentation.\n\n## Persuading\n\nAgain, this is heavily oriented toward job talks in academia.\nI think the takeaway for me is that you show aim to present yourself within 5 minutes, with your vision and contributions.\nFor vision, describe the problem you're trying to solve and your approach.\n\nThe concept of Winston'star is quite interesting - when describing your contributions you should include the following:\n- Symbol\n- Slogan\n- Surprise\n- Salient\n- Story\n\nAs for why you should spend some time to practice this...\n\n\u003e You get used to being famous, but you never get used to being ignored.\n\n## How to stop\n\nAt the last slide, highlights your contributions.\n\nEnd your talk with a joke if possible.\n\n\u003e I always finish with a joke, and that way people think they've had fun the whole time\n\nDo not say thank you at the end. Instead, salute the audience.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-12T02:09:05.416035271Z","tags":[]},"/notes/LLM":{"title":"Large Language Model","content":"## Before LLM\n\n\u003e Until 2017, most NMT models, including the one that powered Google Translate, were [recurrent neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network). RNNs use [Long Short-Term Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) (LSTM) cells to factor word order into their calculations.[^2]\n\n\u003e In 2017, a landmark paper titled “[Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)” changed the way data scientists approach NMT and other NLP tasks. That paper proposed a better way to process language based on _transformer models_ that eschew LSTMs and use [neural attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_(machine_learning)) mechanisms to model the context in which words are used.\n\n![language-model](assets/language-model.png)\n\n![language-model-2](assets/language-model-2.png)\n\n![language-model-3](assets/language-model-3.png)\n## BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)\n\n\u003e BERT isn’t generally useful by itself, but it can be fine-tuned to perform specific tasks such as sentiment analysis or question answering. Fine-tuning is accomplished by further training the pre-trained model with task-specific samples at a reduced learning rate, and it is _much_ less expensive and time-consuming than training BERT from scratch.\n\n![bert](assets/bert.png)\n\n\u003e Aside from the fact that it was trained with a huge volume of text, the key to BERT’s ability to understand human language is an innovation known as [Masked Language Modeling](https://analyticsindiamag.com/a-complete-tutorial-on-masked-language-modelling-using-bert/). MLM turns a large corpus of text into a training ground for learning the structure of a language. When BERT models are pretrained, a specified percentage of the words in each batch of text – usually 15% – are randomly removed or “masked” so the model can learn to predict the missing words from the words around them. Unidirectional models look at the text to the left or the text to the right and attempt to predict what the missing word should be. MLM uses text on the left _and_ right to inform its decisions.\n\n## GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)\n\n\u003e Unlike BERT, GPT models can perform certain NLP tasks such as text translation and question-answering _without fine-tuning_, a feat known as _zero-shot_ or _few-shot learning_.\n\u003e ...\n\u003e ChatGPT is a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5, which itself is a fined-tuned version of GPT-3. At its heart, ChatGPT is a transformer encoder-decoder that responds to prompts by iteratively predicting the first word in the response, then the second word, and so on.\n\n\u003e The entire body of knowledge present on the Internet in September 2021 (and then some) was baked into those 175 billion parameters during training. It’s akin to you answering a question off the top of your head rather than reaching for your phone and Googling for an answer. When Microsoft incorporated GPT-4 into Bing, they added a separate layer providing Internet access.\n\n## [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)\n\n\u003e The [LLaMA model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13971.pdf) has a very similar architecture to GPT-J. It uses the same positional encoding ([RoPE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09864.pdf)), similar activation function (SiLU instead of GELU). The main differences are:\n\u003e - no bias tensors\n\u003e - some new normalization layers\n\u003e - extra tensor in the feed-forward part\n\u003e - a slightly different order of the operations\n\u003e - seems context size is not fixed? (if I understand correctly the code)[^1]\n\n## Applications\n\n### LangChain\n\n\u003e ...it makes it easy to call OpenAI’s GPT, say, a dozen times in a loop to answer a single question, and mix in queries to Wikipedia and other databases.\n\u003e The clever bit is that, using LangChain, you _intercept_ GPT when it starts a line with _“Act:”_ and then you go and do that action for it, feeding the results back in as an _“Observation”_ line so that it can “think” what to do next.[^3]\n\n## [Prompt Injection](notes/Prompt%20Injection.md)\n\n## Fine-Tuning\n\nHow to generate training data https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36070533\n1. make your own RLHF dataset - like OpenAI and Open Assistant\n2. exfiltrate data from a bigger/better LLM - Vicuna \u0026 family\n3. use your pre-trained LLM to generate RLAIF data, no leeching - ConstitutionalAI, based on a set of rules instead of labelling examples\n\nHow to use it with vector store https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36070797\n\u003e I would strongly recommend against fine-tuning over a set of documents as this is a very lossy information system retrieval system. LLMs are not well suited for information retrieval like databases and search engines.\n\u003e \n\u003e The applications of fine-tuning that we are seeing have a lot of success is making completion models like LLaMA or original GPT3 become prompt-able. In essence, prompt-tuning or instruction-tuning. That is, giving it the ability to respond with a user prompt, llm output chat interface.\n\u003e \n\u003e Vector databases, for now, are a great way to store mappings of embeddings of documents with the documents themselves for relevant-document information retrieval.\n\nUsing vector store with fine-tuning https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36079880\n\n\u003e I want the user to be able to ask technical questions about a set of documents, then the user should retrieve a summary-answer from those documents along with a source.\n\u003e \n\u003e I first need to finetune GPT4 so it better understands the niche-specific technical questions, the words used, etc. I could ask the finetuned model questions, but it won't really know from where it got the information. Without finetuning the summarised answer will suffer, or it will pull out the wrong papers.\n\u003e \n\u003e Then I need to use a vector database to store the technical papers for the model to access; now I can ask questions, get a decent answer, and will have access to the sources.\n\n## AI Safety\n\n### Human in the Loop\n\nThe danger of using MTurk as a \"human in the loop\" to fact-check LLM responses[^4]:\n\n\u003e It is tempting to rely on crowdsourcing to validate LLM outputs or to create human gold-standard data for comparison. But what if crowd workers themselves are using LLMs, e.g., in order to increase their productivity, and thus their income, on crowdsourcing platforms?\n\n\n[^1]: https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues/33#issuecomment-1465108022\n[^2]: https://www.atmosera.com/ai/understanding-chatgpt/ \"Understanding ChatGPT\"\n[^3]: https://interconnected.org/home/2023/03/16/singularity \"The surprising ease and effectiveness of AI in a loop\"\n[^4]: https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/14/mechanical-turk-workers-are-using-ai-to-automate-being-human/ \"Mechanical Turk workers are using AI to automate being human\"","lastmodified":"2023-07-12T02:09:05.416035271Z","tags":[]},"/notes/LLM101x":{"title":"Large Language Models: Application through Production","content":"\nI signed up [Large Language Models: Application through Production](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:Databricks+LLM101x+2T2023/home) by Databricks on edX to learn more about applications of [Large Language Model](notes/LLM.md).

Made possible by transformer architecture since ~2017.\n\nPrimitives:\n- Token: basic building block of language models. Words, sub-words, characters, etc.\n- Sentence: sequence of tokens.\n- Vocabulary: complete list of tokens.\n\nTokenization:\n1. Words:\n   1. Intuitive\n   2. Big vocabulary\n   3. Complications such as misspelling, out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, etc.\n2. Characters:\n   1. Small vocabulary\n   2. No OOV\n   3. Long sequences\n   4. No word-level semantics\n3.

There is another [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) that seems totally overkill for Advent of Code, but could be useful when building a real application. Below is how the project looks.\n\n```bash\n% exa -T                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               (main)\n.\n├── cmd\n│  └── cli\n│     └── main.go\n├── input\n│  └── 2022\n│     ├── day01.txt\n│     └── day02.txt\n├── internal\n│  └── year2022\n│     ├── day1.go\n│     ├── day2.go\n│     └── year2022.go\n├── go.mod\n├── go.sum\n├── LICENSE\n└── README.md\n```\n\nI don't expect anyone to import anything from this repo. Therefore I put the solutions inside `internal`, which has special handling for Go projects ([more details on `internal packages`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8kOo3r51b2BWtTs_1uADIA5djfXhPT36s6eHVRIvaU/edit)).\n\nI also build a small CLI tool to run the solutions. Building CLI application is straightforward with the [`flag` package](https://pkg.go.dev/flag). I decided to read the input from STDIN by default. This can be done by using `bufio.Scanner`[^1]. This helps to test the solutions with the smaller example inputs, as below. Note that on macOS, you need to type `Ctrl+D` to signify the end of the input[^2].\n\n```shell\n% go run ./cmd/cli -year 2022 -day 1 -part 1\nYear: 2022, Day: 1, Part: 1\n1000\n2000\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n6000\n\n7000\n8000\n9000\n\n10000\nTop most calories: [24000]\n```\n\nIt's also possible to pipe the input to STDIN, which is what I do when running the full input. For example:\n```shell\ncat input/2022/day02.txt | go run ./cmd/cli -year 2022 -day 2 -part 2\n```\n\n## Go Basics\n\n[Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) is a very useful reference.\n\n### Operators\n\nIn Go, `%` computes the \"remainder\" as opposed to the \"modulus\"[^5]. Therefore, unlike other languages like Python, `%` can return negative numbers in Go. Below is a branchless implementation of Python's `%` operator.\n\n```go\nfunc mod(a, b int) int {\n    return (a % b + b) % b\n}\n```\n\n### Slices\n\n### Sorting\n\nComing from Python and Ruby, sorting in Go requires several more steps and feels slightly cumbersome. There is [sort.Ints](http://golang.org/pkg/sort/#Ints) to sorts a slice of `int`s, but only in increasing order. Generally, you need to implement the [sort.Interface](http://golang.org/pkg/sort/#Interface) interface if you want to sort something and [sort.Reverse](http://golang.org/pkg/sort/#Reverse) just returns a different implementation of that interface that redefines the `Less` method[^3]. At the end, the following does the reverse, but I am still wrapping my head around it.\n\n```go\nsort.Sort(sort.Reverse(sort.IntSlice(numbers)))\n```\n\n### Concatenation\n\nThis is much easier because `append` is a variadic function, therefore you can just do it with three-dots[^6]:\n\n```go\nappend([]int{1,2}, []int{3,4}...)\n```\n\n### Strings\n\nIn AoC, the input comes from an input file, and it's common to manipulate each line for the tasks. The [`strings` package](https://pkg.go.dev/strings) has plenty of useful methods to handle strings.\n\nStrings are constructed by *runes*, identified by single-quotes, e.g. `'a'`. To convert a slice of runes to a string, you can simply use `string`, e,g,\n\n```go\ns := string([]rune{ 'a', 'b', 'c' })\n```\n\n#### Regexp\n\nPackage [`regexp`](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp) implements regular expression search. It's based on RE2 syntax[^7]. Example for matching with capturing groups:\n\n```go\nr, _ := regexp.Compile(`move ([\\d]+) from ([\\d]+) to ([\\d]+)`)\nmatches := r.FindStringSubmatch(line)\nlog.Printf(\"move %v from %v to %v\", matches[1], matches[2], matches[3])\n```\n\n### Enum\n\nThere is real enums in Go, and looks like people work around it by using constants and type definition. Below is an example:\n```go\ntype Color int\n\nconst (\n\tRed Color = iota\n\tOrange\n\tYellow\n\tGreen\n\tBlue\n\tIndigo\n\tViolet\n)\n```\n\nIt also uses the *constant generator* `iota`. In a `const` declaration, the value of `iota` begins at zero and increments by one for each item in the sequence[^4]. You can also use `iota` in more complex expressions, e.g. building bit masks.\n\nIt seems like you can also use the [`stringer`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer)  package to generate `String()` methods for your enum type. But I haven't figured out how to use it yet.\n\n[^1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20895552/how-can-i-read-from-standard-input-in-the-console \"How can I read from standard input in the console?\"\n[^2]: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/16333/how-to-signal-the-end-of-stdin-input \"How to signal the end of stdin input\"\n[^3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18343208/how-do-i-reverse-sort-a-slice-of-integer-go \"How do I reverse sort a slice of integer Go?\"\n[^4]: https://www.gopl.io/ \"The Go Programming Language\"\n[^5]: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/448#issuecomment-66049769 \"Modulus returns negative numbers\"\n[^6]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16248241/concatenate-two-slices-in-go \"Concatenate two slices in Go\"\n[^7]: https://golang.org/s/re2syntax \"RE2 Syntax\"","lastmodified":"2023-07-12T02:09:05.416035271Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Learning-Zig":{"title":"Learning Zig","content":"\n## Installation\n\nZig is moving fast, so I do not recommend installing it from the package manager (e.g. Homebrew, nix, etc.) as they are usually lagged.\nInstead, follow what [zigleanr](https://ziglearn.org/#installation) suggests, download the latest master build from https://ziglang.org/download/ and put it in your `$PATH`.\nNote that you want to put the entire directory in your `$PATH` instead of the binary itself; otherwise you will get an error like this:\n\n```\nerror: unable to find zig installation directory '/usr/local/bin/zig': FileNotFound\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\n[ziglings](https://github.com/ziyunli/ziglings)\n\n## Built-in\n\nThe `@import()` function is built into Zig.\nIt returns a value which represents the imported code.\n\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n```\n\n## Types\n\n### Arrays\n\n*Is it allocated on the heap?*\n\nInitialization with `[n]type{ ... }`\n\n```zig\nvar foo = [_]u32{ 42, 108, 5423 };\n```\n\nConcatenate with `++`\n\n```zig\nvar foo = [_]u32{ 42, 108, 5423 } ++ [_]u32{ 42, 108, 5423 };\n```\n\nRepeat with `**`\n\n```zig\nvar foo = [_]u32{ 42, 108, 5423 } ** 2;\n```\n\n### Strings\n\nStrings use double quotes.

This means, it doesn't run in the execution loop of the browser and as such needs an external process (Node, ...) to drive it. It's a bit like Selenium, which by default uses its own protocol+implementation to drive the browser (the web-drivers). Note that from the version 4,Selenium can now use the _CDP_ protocol and its features.\n\nCypress is an Electron App (Native JS app on desktop) which embeds the browser window in it. The library and your code are directly injected in the execution loop of the browser and needs to modify its default behavior to achieve this. It uses its own implementation for this purpose although a smoother integration with _CDP_ is in progress, but it's not exposed via its API. Node is also used, but the main part of the control is delegated to the custom injected library (in the same process, I guess). PW (as Puppeteer) delegates this control to the _CDP_ implementation of the browser, which is standardized and maintained by the browser providers.\n\nWhat are some consequences coming from these differences?\n\n- Cypress is limited to JavaScript and transpiled languages as it runs in the browser. Playwright is language independent and gets by default JS/TS, Python, C# and Java support. But you can easily use it with other frameworks/languages like RobotFramework for instance.\n- Cypress needs some adaptation for each type of browser, and currently Safari is not supported. Playwright is supported on all the modern browsers and even gets experimental support for native mobile testing.\n- CP doesn't support tabs. PW does.\n- Support of iframes is possible with CP but has sometimes an erratic behavior and is harder to use than with PW in our experience.\n- As it runs directly in the browser, you can set up [some shortcuts in your test/fixtures](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/01/03/stop-using-page-objects-and-start-using-app-actions/) for more efficiency with CP. It means that you can also implement Component/Unit tests with it, and it's [a promising feature](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2021/04/06/introducing-the-cypress-component-test-runner/). PW is focused on E2E/System tests, and you need another framework to handle the Unit/Component testing part (Jest, Karma/Jasmine ...). You have the choice to use a single framework or 2 different with CP. On the opposite, your tests are more close to the real end user's experience with PW as with CP which modifies the browser's behavior.\n- Although the integration with some high level (Acceptance/BDD) frameworks is possible, it's not as easy and more limited than with PW. For instance, when we integrate CP with CucumberJS the test runner is provided by CP and the structure of your scenarios and your implemented steps is more constraining. PW not only offers an integration with [CucumberJS](https://ediblecode.com/blog/playwright-cucumber-js/), [RobotFramework](https://rpaframework.org/libraries/browser_playwright/), [Gauge](https://spectrum.chat/gauge/general/gauge-test-runner-with-playwright-npm-package~7f961965-14d8-402b-a09e-c62c31ff3824), but [CodeceptJS](https://codecept.io/playwright/) provides also an official and excellent support for it and CP is not on their roadmap.\n- On the CI aspect. If you don't master the building agents configuration, you probably need a containerization solution (Docker) to deploy it. We just need _npm install_ for PW.\n- Another point is about test parallelization. PW does provide it out of the box for free. CP doesn't. You'll have to subscribe to their SaaS offer to run your tests in parallel, or find [some workarounds](https://github.com/sorry-cypress/sorry-cypress) which are not perfect.\n- Remote browsing concern: Playwright is compliant with an internal/self-hosted Selenium grid ([https://playwright.dev/docs/selenium-grid](https://playwright.dev/docs/selenium-grid)). Both are supported on SaaS solutions (BrowserStack, ...)\n- On the UI/API aspect, they are relatively close. Both provide a runner, API mocking and fixtures, advanced locators, .... PW uses a classical pattern to manage asynchronicity (async/await) and CP has chosen a kind of _promise_ answer (dot notation, which is in definitive not totally async) to simplify the code with autocompletion. To structure and reuse your code, CP also has a different approach with [custom commands](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands) to extend the _cy_ keyword which is somewhat similar to the user centric approach of [TestingLibrary](https://testing-library.com/) or Codecept (the _I_ prefix).","lastmodified":"2023-07-12T02:09:05.416035271Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Practical-Deep-Learning-for-Coders-2022":{"title":"Practical Deep Learning for Coders 2022","content":"\nProgress:\n- [x] [1: Getting started](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html)\n- [x] [2: Deployment](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson2.html)\n- [x] [3: Neural net foundations](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson3.html)\n- [ ] [4: Natural Language (NLP)](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson4.html)\n\n# 2.

Expect risk and sacrifice. Expect bumps in the road. When you hit the first pothole (and yes, it will happen) know that you are forging the process of your unfolding story. **The Fastlane process demands sacrifices that few make, to resolve to live like few can.**\n- Wealth is a formula, not an ingredient.\n- Process makes millionaires. Events are by-products of process.\n- To seek a “wealth chauffeur” is to seek a surrogate for process. Process cannot be outsourced, because process dawns wisdom, personal growth, strength, and events.\n  \n   \u003e If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there. ~ Lewis Carroll\n  \n  Wealth is not authored by material possessions, money, or “stuff,” but by what I call the three fundamental “F's”…\n- Family (relationships)\n- Fitness (health)\n- Freedom (choice)\n\n## The Fastlane Roadmap\n\n### Fastlane\n\n1.  Controllable Unlimited Leverage (CUL): whereas the Slowlane is defined by uncontrollable variables with no leverage, the Fastlane exploits the opposite conditions: maximum control and leverage.\n2. Business: your own business, self-employment, and entrepreneurship are centrist to the Fastlane, much like a job is to the Slowlane.\n3. Lifestyle: the Fastlane is a lifestyle choice: a commitment of blended beliefs, processes, and actions.\n4. Rapid Wealth Creation: the Fastlane is about creating large sums of wealth rapidly and beyond the confines of “middle class.”\n\n### The Fastlane Mindposts\n\n**Debt Perception:**  \nDebt is useful if it allows me to build and grow my system.\n\n**Time Perception:**  \nTime is the most important asset I have, far exceeding money.\n\n**Education Perception:**  \nThe moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing. Constant expansion of my knowledge and awareness is critical to my journey.\n\n**Money Perception:**  \nMoney is everywhere, and it's extremely abundant. Money is a reflection of how many lives I've touched. Money reflects the value I've created.\n\n**Primary Income Source:**  \nI earn income via my business systems and investments.\n\n**Primary Wealth Accelerator:**  \nI make something from nothing. I give birth to assets and make them valuable to the marketplace. Other times, I take existing assets and add value to them.\n\n**Wealth Perception:**  \nBuild business systems for cash flow and asset valuation.\n\n**Wealth Equation:**  \nWealth = Net Profit + Asset Value\n\n**Strategy:**  \nThe more I help, the richer I become in time, money, and personal fulfillment.\n\n**Destination:**  \nLifetime passive income, either through business or investments.\n\n**Responsibility % Control:**  \nLife is what I make it. My financial plan is entirely my responsibility, and I choose how I react to my circumstances.\n\n**Life Perception:**  \nMy dreams are worth pursuing, no matter how outlandish, and I understand that it will take money to make some of those dreams real.\n\n### The Fastlane Is a Business System: The Slowlane Is a Job\n\nThe Slowlane is a job: your hard work traded for your employer's cash.\n\n### Be a Producer: Leverage the Business of a System\n\nWhen you reframe your thinking from majority thinking (consumer) to minority thinking (producer), you effectively switch teams and allegiances. Yes, become a producer first and a consumer second.\n\nTo switch teams and become a producer, you need to be an entrepreneur and an innovator. You need to be a visionary and a creator. You need to give birth to a business and offer the world value.\n- Producers are indigenous to the Fastlane roadmap.\n- Producers are the minority as are the rich, while consumers are the majority as are the poor.\n- When you succeed as a producer, you can consume anything you want.\n- **Fastlaners are producers, entrepreneurs, innovators, visionaries, and creators**.\n- A business does not make a Fastlane-some businesses are jobs in disguise.\n- The Fastlane wealth equation is not bound by time and its variables are unlimited and controllable.\n  \n  \u003e Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go. ~ TS Eliot\n  \n  Wealth = Net Profit + Asset Value\n  Net Profit = (Units Sold) X (Unit Profit)\n  Asset Value = (Net Profit) X (Industry Multiplier\n  \n  **The valuation of your company is predicated on the subjective PE for your particular industry.**\n  \n  Stocks trading on the public markets define the multiplier for each respective company by the price-to-earnings ratio, or PE. If a company's stock trades at 10 times PE, investors are purchasing that company at a multiple of 10 times.\n- The key to the Fastlane wealth equation is to have a high speed limit, or an unlimited range of values for units sold. This creates leverage. The market for your product or service determines your upper limit.\n- The higher your speed limit, the higher your income potential.\n- The primary wealth accelerant for the rich is asset value, defined as appreciable assets created, founded, or bought.\n- Wealth creation via asset value is accelerated by each industry's average multiplier. For every dollar in net income realized, the asset value multiplies by a factor of the multiple.\n- Your industry of specialization will determine the average multiple that determines your wealth accelerant factor. If the multiple is 3, your WAF is 300%.\n- Liquidation events transform appreciated assets (“paper” net worth) into money (“real” net worth) that can be transformed into another passive income stream: a money system.\n\n### The Five Fastlane Business Seedlings\n- Rental Systems\n\t- Real estate,\n\t- licenses, and\n\t- patents\n- Computer/Software Systems\n\t- Internet and software businesses\n- Content Systems\n\t- Authoring books,\n\t- blogging, and\n\t- magazines\n- Distribution Systems\n\t- Franchising,\n\t- chaining,\n\t- network marketing, and\n\t- television marketing\n- Humam Resource Systems\n\t- Human resource systems can add or subtract to passivity.\n\t- Human resource systems are the most expensive to manage and implement.\n- To divorce yourself from the Slowlane's transactional relationship of “time for money,” you need to become a producer, specifically, a business owner.\n- **Business systems break the bond between “your time for money” because they act like surrogate operatives for your time trade.**\n- If you have a passive income that exceeds all your needs and lifestyle expenses including taxes, you're retired.\n- Retirement can happen at any age.\n- The fruit from a money tree is passive income.\n- **A Fastlane objective is to create a business system that survives time, exclusive of your time.**\n  \n  \n  **The source of their wealth comes from their business interests, while their liquid cash reserves are tied into fixed-income securities like municipal bonds, treasuries, and other highly liquid and safe investments. The rich aren't using the markets to create wealth; they're increasing their existing wealth with leveraged business assets. **\n  \n  the compound interest weapon is most effective with large sums of money.\n  \n  The point of this illustration is to show that the rich aren't using compound interest to get wealthy; they're using it for income and liquidity.\n  \n  As for earning your $10 million, that solution lies in exponential leveraged growth stemming from a Fastlane business-net income plus asset value-NOT in expenses, NOT in the stock market, and NOT in a job.\n- **Fastlaners (the rich) don't use compound interest or the markets to get wealthy but to create income and preserve liquidity.**\n- **Fastlaners eventually become net lenders**: people pay you to use YOUR MONEY in the form of interest or ownership.\n\n###  The Law of Effection\nThe Law of Effection states that **the more lives you affect in an entity you control, in scale and/or magnitude, the richer you will become. **\n\n**To exploit the Law of Effection, your business needs to make an impact of either scale or magnitude, or both.** Within our Fastlane wealth equation, “scale” and “magnitude” are implicit to our “net profit” variable.\n\n\u003e NET PROFIT = Units Sold (Scale) X Unit Profit (Magnitude)\n\nRetrace the source of millionaire money and you will find millions of something.\n\nEffection of scale or magnitude always precedes money, either directly or indirectly. The more lives you impact, directly or indirectly, the more wealth you will attract.\n\nThe closer you get to the source of large numbers, the closer you will get to wealth. To serve millions is to make millions. Think big to earn big.\n\n### To Pay Yourself First, You Must Own Yourself\n\nThe best business structures for your Fastlane business are:\n- C corporation\n- S corporation\n- Limited liability corporation\n  \n  Each has its advantages and disadvantages, but all share two common benefits: **limitation of liability and tax efficiency**.\n\n#### The C Corporation\n\nThe C corporation is a business structure that survives time and can be easily transferred. **Corporate profits are taxed at corporate income tax rates, with net income distributed to shareholders.**\n\nSome C-corp owners use this structure to deploy a strategy known as “income splitting.” The strategy is to partition the business's income to both the owner and the business, effectively lowering the tax bracket of the two, versus a large income for just one.\n\nWhile C corporations and their owners are subject to double taxation (tax on corporate profits and dividends to shareholders), they are advantageous for larger corporations and corporations with an “asset growth” strategy. In other words, **if you don't plan on distributing profits and are focused on building “asset value” over “net profit,” C corporations do the job**. The majority of publicly traded companies are C corps that do not distribute dividends to their shareholders. They grow revenue and asset value.\n\n#### The S Corporation\n\nAn S corporation is like a C corporation except that it isn't taxed as a separate entity. **Considered a “pass-through” entity, taxes aren't paid at the corporate level, but at the individual level and reflected on the owner's personal tax return.** S corporations also have some tax advantages because profits are not subject to the hefty self-employment tax that comes with sole proprietorships. However, unlike C corporations, which can have limitless owners, S corporations are limited to 100 owners and will have additional filing requirements.\n\n#### The Limited Liability Corp (LLC)\n\nAn LLC operates just like **a corporation with the benefits of a partnership or a sole proprietorship**. **LLC profit passes through to its owners, called members, and is reflected on their personal income tax.** LLCs are also considered “pass-through” entities because profit passes directly to the owners. For partnerships, the LLC or the S corp is the recommended structure in lieu of a general partnership, which, again, does not offer liability protection.\n\nFor small startups, I recommend either an LLC or an S corp. Stay away from partnerships and sole-proprietorships, as they do not limit liability.\n\nSelecting an entity depends on your goals and your vision for your business. Here are some general questions to help you decide.\n- What is your exit strategy? Go public? Sell to private investors?\n- What is your growth strategy?\n- What is your liability exposure in the worst case?\n- Do you plan on raising capital now, or in the future?\n- Do you plan to hire employees?\n- Do you plan to take on new partners?\n- Do you plan on earning profits fast? Or not for a while?\n  \n  **If you aren't where you want to be, the problem is your choices. Your circumstances are the symptoms of those choices.**\n\n### Worse Case Consequence Analysis (WCCA)\n\nWCCA asks you to answer three questions about every decision of consequence:\n- What is the worst-case consequence of this choice?\n- What is the probability of this outcome?\n- Is this an acceptable risk?\n- ## The Weighted Average Decision Matrix (WADM)\n\n### Turn Your Back to Farting Headwinds\n\nThe more uncanny and exceptional you strive to be, the more you need to fight through social indoctrination. Extraordinary wealth will require you to have extraordinary beliefs.\n\nJoin entrepreneur clubs, attend networking events, ally yourself with like-minders, get yourself around people who subscribe to a Fastlane, anything is-possible mindset, and decide who you want on your team of warriors.\n\n### YOUR PRIMORDIAL FUEL: TIME\n\n\u003e _Time isn't a commodity, something you pass around like a cake. Time is the substance of life. When anyone asks you to give your time, they're really asking for a chunk of your life._  ~Antoinette Bosco\n\nValue your time poorly and you will be poor.\n\n“Your money can't save you anymore than it can save me.\n\nThe greatest theft of all humanity is to act as if our time on this Earth is infinite when it isn't.\n\nThe reality is that time is deathly scarce, while money is richly abundant.\n\nMoney buys free time and eliminates indentured time.\n\nIndentured time becomes the ransom of your free time.\n\nAny debt that forces you to work is reclassified from free time and shifts it to indentured time.\n\nFastlaners are frugal with time, while Slowlaners are frugal with money.\n\n### Continuous Education\n\nWhen you continually inject yourself with new education, new skills, and new competencies, new roads open and things run smoothly. The right education has incredible horsepower.\n\nFastlane education is to foster growth of the business system.\n\nYou learn from engagement, from doing, and from getting out and taking repeated action, more so than from any book or professor.\n\nYour commitment of pursuit, and then the biggie: applying it.\n\nTo start your oil recharge, choose a topic that interests you or an area in your life that needs improvement.\n\nSeminars can be great for education, but it has to be the right seminar, which is affordable and given by producers and experienced experts, not by professional, career public speakers.\n\n### Hit the Redline\n\n\u003e If things seem under control, you are just not going fast enough. ~ Mario Andretti\n\nWinners are forged at the Redline. What's the Redline? The Redline is pure, unadulterated commitment.\n\nTo get out of first gear, you must make a concerted effort and a lineage of good choices to exploit the power of the Fastlane. There's a profound difference between interest and commitment.\n\nInterest works on your business an hour a day Monday through Friday; commitment works on your business seven days a week whenever time permits.\n\nThe brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out; the brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. The brick walls are there to stop the people who don't want it badly enough. They are there to stop the othe...\n\nTiming is rarely perfect. Waiting empowers mediocrity. People sit around waiting their entire lives for the perfect this, the perfect that. The perfect scenarios and circumstances never arrive. What does arrive? Time, old age, and the specter of a dream lost.\n- **Interest is first gear. Commitment is the Redline.**\n- **Hard work and commitment separates the winners from the losers**.\n- Some choose short-term mediocre comfort over long-term meteoric comfort.\n- **To live unlike everyone else, you have to do what everyone else won't**.\n- Arm your expectations to hard work, sacrifice, and other bumps in the road. These are the land mines where the weak are removed from the road and sent back to the land of “most people.”\n- Failure is natural to success. Expect it and learn from it.\n- One home run could set you financially secure for your life, perhaps generations.\n- Home runs can't be hit in the dug out.\n- Moronic risks have unlimited downside (long term) and limited upside (short term).\n- Intelligent risks have unlimited upside (long term) and limited downside (short term.)\n- **There is never perfect timing and waiting for “someday” just wastes time**.\n## The Roads to Wealth\n\nIf you're a Fastlaner, your road is a business: Internet entrepreneur, real estate investor, author, or inventor.\n\nIn the Fastlane, you engineer a business that touches millions of lives in scale, or many lives of magnitude. If your road doesn't lead through Effection's neighborhood or have an off-ramp onto it, sorry, you're on the wrong road.\n\nTo light the Law of Effection and illuminate your Fastlane road, cross-examine it against the Five Fastlane Commandments (NECST, pronounced “next”).\n1. The Commandment of Need\n2. The Commandment of Entry\n3. The Commandment of Control\n4. The Commandment of Scale\n5. The Commandment of Time\n\nThe best roads and the purest Fastlanes satisfy the Five Fastlane Commandments: Need, Entry, Control, Scale, and Time.\n\n### The Commandment of Need\n\n**Businesses that solve needs win. Businesses that provide value win.**\n\nReflect back to our producer/consumer dichotomy. Consumers are selfish. They demand to know is “what's in it for me!” To succeed as a producer, surrender your own selfishness and address the selfishness of others.\n\nStop thinking about business in terms of your selfish desires. Instead, **chase needs, problems, pain points, service deficiencies, and emotions.**\n\nYou and your business attract money when you stop being selfish and turn your business's focus from the needs of yourself to the needs of other people. Give first, take second. Needs come first, not money! Needs precede money!\n- Is there a *need* in my neighborhood for a martial arts studio?\n- What are existing martial arts studios doing wrong that I *could do better*?\n- What improved *value* do I offer the martial arts student?\n- What *assets* do I bring to this community?\n  \n  Money chasers are consumers who haven't quite made the transition to producer. They want to be producers, but they selfishly think like consumers.\n  \n  Want to make big bucks? Then *start attracting money instead of chasing it*. \n  \n  Money isn't attracted to selfish people. It is attracted to businesses that solve problems. It's attracted to people who fill needs and add value. Solve needs massively and money massively attracts.\n  \n  The amount of money in your life is merely a reflection to the amount of value you have given to others.\n  \n  The motivational fuel for the Fastlane is passion, not love. Passion gets you out of the garage and onto the road. If you have a passion for a specific goal, you'll do anything for it. \n  \n  Passion beats “do what you love,” because passion fuels motivation for something greater than yourself and is generalized. Passion comes from either excitement or discontent.\n- Ninety percent of all new businesses fail because they are based on selfish internal needs, not external market needs.\n- No one cares about your selfish desires for dreams or money; people only want to know what your business can do for them.\n- Chase money and it will elude you. However, if you ignore it and focus on what attracts money, you will draw it to yourself.\n\n### The Commandment of Need\n\nThe Commandment of Entry states that *as entry barriers to any business road fall, or lessen, the effectiveness of that road declines while competition in that field subsequently strengthens*.\n\n If you violate the Commandment of Entry, be prepared to be exceptional. Exceptionality breaks the odds of entry.\n\nLack of entry itself creates the marketplace, and to succeed in that marketplace, you have to be exceptional.\n\nAnd if you are exceptional, easy entry becomes not a liability, but an asset.\n\nWant to know if your business violates entry? The answer is another simple question: **as entry barriers to any business road fall, or lessen, the effectiveness of that road declines while competition in that field subsequently strengthens.**.\n\nWhen it comes to money, the best warning flag is “everyone.” Everyone is a red flag that the Commandment of Entry has been violated. If everyone is engaged in the same activity, it surely will fail.\n- The Commandment of Entry states that as entry barriers fall, competition rises and the road weakens.\n- Businesses with weak entry often lack control and operate in saturated marketplaces.\n\n### The Commandment of Control\n\nWhen you control your business, you control everything in your business-*your organization, your products, your pricing, your revenue model, and your operational choices*. If you can't control every aspect of your company, you're not driving! \n\n In general:\n- Drivers create MLM companies; they don't join them.\n- Drivers sell franchises; they don't buy them.\n- Drivers offer affiliate programs; they don't join them.\n- Drivers run hedge funds; they don't invest in them.\n- Drivers sell stock; they don't buy stock.\n- Drivers offer drop-shipping; they don't use drop-shipping.\n- Drivers offer employment; they don't get employed.\n- Drivers accept rents and royalties; they don't pay rents and royalties.\n- Drivers sell licenses; they don't buy them.\n- Drivers sell IPO shares; they don't buy them.\n  \n  Build corporate ladders-don't join them. Build pyramid organizations-don't join them. Think manufacture, not retail. \n  \n  The real essence of MLM, which is sales, distribution, and training-not entrepreneurship. As a network marketer, you don't own a business-you own a job managing and creating a sales organization.\n  \n  Stop climbing pyramids and start building them.\n\n### The Commandment of Scale\n\nIn business, to be a success you only have to be right once. \n\nWithout leverage, you can't create wealth exponentially. \n\nTo achieve scale, magnitude or reach must increase.\n\nHow do you know if your business (or potential business) honors the Commandment of Scale? Ask:\n- Can the net income of this business scale limitlessly, say, from $2,000 per month to $200,000?\n- Can the asset value of this business scale into the millions?\n- Can this business impact millions? Or does it impact hundreds? Is its customer pool the world or a small community in the city?\n- Can this business be replicated and expanded beyond the local trading area by franchising, chaining, or additional units?\n- Best-case scenario, what is the units-sold potential? One hundred or one hundred million?\n- Best-case scenario, how pliable is unit profit? Does it have magnitude?\n  \n  For the Fastlaner, *the LOE is leveraged by scale or asset value explosion*: Sell millions, help millions, serve millions, impact millions.\n  \n  There are three barricades that prevent entrepreneurs from realizing the Law of Effection: *Scale, Magnitude, and Source*.\n  \n  *The Law of Effection honors only those in control.*\n  \n  If you want access to the Law of Effection, drive a road that can break through scale or magnitude while controlling its source. If you can't be the source, serve the source.\n  \n  If you are two management positions away from a CFO position at a Fortune 100 Company, you have indirect scale and the law is accessible. Fast wealth is possible.\n\n### The Commandment of Time\n\nOwning a business doesn't guarantee wealth or detachment from time. \n\nThe Commandment of Time asks:\n- Can this business be automated and systematized to operate while I'm absent?\n- Are my margins thick enough to hire human resource seedlings?\n- Can my operation benefit from the introduction of a money tree seedling?\n- How can I get this business to operate exclusive of my time?\n  \n  As a Fastlaner, your road should be traveled with the intention to make it automated. You want passivity and a living money tree. When you fail the commandment of time, the failure is cause by one of two obstacles. They are:\n- You don't have access to the seeds because your road started with a deficiency.\n- The seeds won't grow in infertile soil.\n\n### Fastlane Purity\n\nThou shalt not invest in a needless business. Thou shalt not trade time for money. Thou shalt not operate on a limited scale. Thou shalt not relinquish control. Thou shalt not let a business startup be an event over process.\n### Internet\n- Subscription-based: Offer users access to data, information, or software, and charge a monthly fee. Data can be leads, sales information, a proprietary database, or good old fashioned pornography.\n- Content-based: \"I consider content-based revenue models the most difficult for success because entry barriers have significantly declined and its success is predicated on high traffic. Also, content systems heavily engage in affiliate programs, which is a hitchhiking structure.\"\n- Lead generation: Lead generation services often provide a service to consumers while simultaneously aggregating a non-homogeneous industry. Lead generation is popular with fragmented industries, where the industry players consist of mostly small to medium-sized businesses. Lead generation solves two needs: 1) The consumer's desire to save time and money and 2) The business owner's need to find new customers inexpensively.\n- Social Networks: Social networks are spin-offs of content systems.\n- Brokerage Systems: Brokers bring buyers and sellers together and facilitate transactions. They are market-makers for a particular industry and earn money typically on each transaction.\n- Advertising: Similar to brokerages, advertisers merge buyers and sellers together and accept advertising fees in lieu of transaction fees.\n- E-Commerce: E-commerce is the act of selling goods, services, and information over the Internet.\n\n#### Innovation\n\nInnovation involves two acts: 1) Manufacture and 2) Distribution.\n\nInvent a product, service, or piece of information, manufacture it, and then distribute\n\nthe core activity of inventors is just taking something and improving or modifying it.\n\nInnovation is a dual challenged process: manufacture and distribution. Inventing a product that solves a need is half the battle; the other half is getting your invention into the hands of millions, which involves a variety of distribution channels: infomercial (sell via mass media), retail (sell to distributors and wholesalers), and direct marketing (sell via print media, postal mail, Internet).\n\nDistribution is where the war is won. Writing a book is not a business; selling the book is.\n\n#### Intentional Iteration\n\nThe process of intentional iteration is the act of satisfying the final commandment, scale. Scale is achieved either through human resource systems or repeated successes.\n\nIteration is a profitable, singles-based business scaled to home runs.\n\n### Competition\n\nOpportunity is rarely about some blockbuster breakthrough like the light bulb or the car, but as simple as an unmet need, or a need not met adequately. Opportunity is a solution to an inconvenience. Opportunity is simplification. Opportunity is a feeling. Opportunity is comfort. Opportunity is better service. Opportunity is fixing pain. Opportunity is putting weak companies out of business.\n\nYou've got a great idea, but someone is already doing it? So what. Do it better.\n\n“Someone is doing it” is a monumental illusion imposing as an impassable obstacle. Someone is always already doing it. The bigger question is, can you do it better? Can you fill the need better, offer greater value, or be a better marketer?\n\n**“Competition is everywhere. Just do it and do it better.”**\n\nDVD rental stores were around for a long time, but that didn't stop NetFlix or RedBox from starting a company and adding “convenience” to the need equation. It was an open road when the road seemed closed.\n\n*Poorly met needs are open roads when they often appear closed.* Successful businesses take existing ideas, services, and products and simply make them better, or spin them in new directions.\n\nHow to Spot Open Roads:\n- \"I hate...\"\n- \"I don't like...\"\n- \"This frustrates me...\"\n- \"Why is this like this?\"\n- \"Do I have to?\"\n- \"I wish there was...\"\n- \"I'm tired of...\"\n- \"This sucks...\"\n  \n  The opportunities of open roads come in easily painted language: **Discomfort, distress, inconvenience, complaints, problems, and performance gaps.** You must attack these challenges and introduce solutions-offer solutions to the masses and I guarantee money will follow! **Moral: Solve other people's problems and you will solve your own money problems!**\n  \n  Yes, quitting your road and changing directions is sometimes the best choice. But be mindful of the distinction between “quitting” and “quitting your road.” Quitting is leaving your dreams for dead and putting them into the bin of impossibility. “Quitting your road” is changing course and turning down a new road.\n\n### Destination\n\nThe tragedy of life doesn't lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach. \n\nThe end of the Fastlane road trip is to crown your happiness with freedom. Freedom from financial encumbrances, freedom to travel, freedom from bosses, alarm clocks, two-hour commutes; freedom from bad ratios (9-to-5, 5-for-2, 2 weeks every 52 weeks and 8% over 40 years) and freedom to enjoy the world as your playground.\n\nLife is not about money, it's about time. \nMoney doesn't change people; it just makes them more of what they already are.\n\nYour destination is the lifestyle you desire while having the freedom to enjoy it. There are two strategies to hit your destination. *The first is a money system in which you amass a lump sum large enough to earn monthly interest that will support your lifestyle needs. The second is a business system that spawns passive cash flow that supports your lifestyle AND simultaneously funds your money system.*\n\nWhat is the price for the freedom and lifestyle you want? Find out with this four-step process:\n1. Define the Lifestyle: What do you want?\n2. Assess the Cost: How much do your dreams cost?\n3. Set the Targets: Set the money system and business income targets.\n4. Make It Real: Fund it and open it!\n\nTo determine your Net Living Cost by dividing Gross Living Cost by .60, or 60%. This will account for potential taxes.\n\n`Net Living Cost = $14,000 / .60 = $23,333/mo`.\n\nTo calculate your money system target, multiply your Net Living Cost by 12, then divide by .05, or 5%.\n\nFor your business system target, multiply your Gross Living Cost by 5.\n\nYou can't make $5,000 per month until you learn how to make $50 per month! It's amazing how people love to skip process and want events.\n\nLive below your means with the intent to expand your means.\n\nSlowlaners seek to minimize expenses while the Fastlaner seeks to maximize income and asset values.\n\n**A money system isn't used to grow wealth but to grow income. Growing wealth should be left to your Fastlane road.**\n\n## Accelerate Wealth\n### The Speed of Success\n\nPlanned obsolescence is a marketer's expectation that whatever they're selling you, you won't use it. And if you don't use it, you are unlikely to ask for your money back.\n\n*Doing nothing is expected.*\n\nSpeed is not thinking about a Fastlane business, but creating it. Speed is uncovering a need and formulating a solution and a prototype. Speed is filing paperwork for your business entity. Speed is building and growing a business. Speed is making contacts and forcing your process out into the world. Speed is approaching your business like a strategic game of chess while your opponents play checkers. Speed is turning off the Playstation.\n\nHow you play each function will determine if you build Fastlane speed or drift aimlessly. Those pieces are:\n- The King: Your execution\n- The Queen: Your marketing\n- The Bishop: Your customer service\n- The Knight: Your product\n- The Rook: Your people\n- The Pawn: Your ideas.\n  \n  An idea trapped in your brain is like a supercar trapped in the garage with a dead battery. It accomplishes nothing and its purpose is untapped.\n  \n  If you want to retire 30 years early, you need a dominant, relentless king. Aloof and blasé kings lose games and don't win races.\n  \n  *The owner of an idea is not he who imagines it, but he who executes it.*\n  \n  \u003e When I started my Web business, several other companies already had established Web sites. Instead of reasoning, “Someone is already doing it,” I executed better and became the leader in my industry. Was my idea spectacular? No. It was an OK idea, but I executed better than the competition. After my revenue model became successful and copied unmercifully, did my business decline and fail? No, because the idea wasn't the lynchpin to success, it was execution. Competitors who copied my idea didn't possess a powerful king to the wealth game, and that is execution. Chess isn't won by stealing pawns.\n  \n  Event versus process. Execution takes process: effort, sacrifice, discipline, and persistence. Ideas are just events.\n\n### Execution\n\nAnytime I launched a new service or feature at my Web site, it was an experiment to see how the world reacted.\n\nThe ultimate judge-and-jury of ideas is the world and the marketplaces that serve them. If the world likes your offer, they vote by giving you their time, their thoughts, or their money. If they don't like your offer, they withhold their money and look elsewhere. And the reall...\n\n*the world tells you which direction you should be going at all times.*\n\nBusiness plans are useless. Yes, I said it. Business plans are useless because they're ideas jacked-up on steroids.\n\nIf you want investors, get out and execute! Create a prototype! Create a brand! Create a track record that others can see or touch! Dive into process. \n\nAngels to private equity never invest in business plans-they invest in people with track records of execution.\n\n### Customer Service\n\n\u003e If you do build a great experience, customers tell each other about that. Word of mouth is very powerful. \n\nA black book: a written record of all complaints, grievances, and issues my business experienced daily.\n\nThere are four types of complaints:\n- Complaints of change: Complaints of change are the least informative and therefore are the ones most difficult to decipher. For my redesign failure, data confirmed that the complaints were substantial. Bounce rates tripled and my conversion ratio suffered.\n- Complaints of expectation: Complaints of expectation occur when you negatively violate the expectation of your customer. If I couldn't manage the complaints, I could manage the expectations. I knew if my customers were making money, they'd keep paying me. Complaints of expectation expose **operational issues, marketing misinformation, and/or product problems**.\n- Complaints of void: Complaints of void are when your customer continually requests something and you simply don't have it. Complaints of void are extremely valuable, as they expose unmet needs. **Complaints of void are goldmines of opportunity.**\n- Complaints of fraud: Fraudulent complaints are the most disheartening because they reflect the worst of society: Illegitimate complaints designed to exploit the business owner. How do you deal with exploitive complainers? You respond once with grace, explain your position, and move on.\n  \n  I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody.\n  \n  As a business owner you must remember that, while you don't have a boss, the person who pays your mortgage is your customer and they always should be heard-but sometimes ignored.\n  \n  While bad customer service is frustrating while playing our consumer role, it gives us entrepreneurs a great opportunity. **Where customer service lacks unearths great opportunity**.\n  \n  Customer discipleship grows businesses exponentially because human resource systems talk.\n  \n  To provide great customer service and explode your business, determine your customers' expectation profile. What are their expectations when they deal with your business? How do they relate to competitors and similar businesses in your industry? Make a subjective call on how your customers expect service. Then VIOLATE IT.\n  \n  Any time you violate your customer's expectations to the positive, you get a dual benefit. First, they buy from you again. Second, raving customers become liaisons and disciples for your business and unpaid human resource systems. Both build speed. Speed builds wealth.\n  \n  Great customer service costs more to provide, but the benefits should outweigh the costs. If more money were spent on pleasing existing clients rather than trying to find new ones, the average business would survive longer than five years.\n  \n  Violate customer's expectations. Create evangelists. Create human resource systems that will work for you, for free. Attract money.\n  \n  Success in business comes from making your customer the boss and the No. 1 stakeholder to your business.\n  \n  Public companies are the worst offenders, as shareholders come first, Wall Street second, and executives third.\n  \n  My repeated, and often preached, motto to my employees was, \"The customer pays your paycheck, not me-keep them happy\".\n  \n  *Look big, act small*. My objective was to look like I had the power of a big company, yet give personal service as if I were a one-person operation. If an entrepreneur thinks they can't compete because you're too big and too well funded, you've won before they've even started. They either engage half-heartedly or defer to another industry with duller competition. Look big, but act small.\n\n### People\n\nYou must make your trust an asset to be earned by others. Let actions speak louder than words.\n\n*Trust, but verify.*\n\nThere are two critical lessons in this experience:\n- A SUCS customer service philosophy must be delivered by your employees.\n- Spectacular product features can't overcome poor service.\n\n### Product\n\n A market is never saturated with a good product ,but it is very quickly saturated with a bad one. \n\nWhat is commoditization? Commoditization is a product or service that appears homogeneous among providers. If your product doesn't standout in the crowd, it doesn't stand a chance and you're forced into the strategy of “cutting prices to stand out from the crowd.”\n\nIf your product isn't someone's knight, standing out from the crowd and differentiating, it stands to be commoditized.\n\nForget about your competition 95% of the time. The other 5% should be used to exploit their weaknesses and differentiate your business. If you forget about your competition, you're forced to focus on your business, which is to innovate and win over the hearts and minds of your customers.\n\n If you are going to take your eye off the road and examine your competitors, expose their weaknesses. **Exploited weakness is where brands are built: Differentiation is a defense to commoditization.** What are they doing wrong? What inefficiency is there? Within the gray area of unsatisfied customers lies differentiation. The only alternative to boorish me-too goods and services is differentiation, and that is accomplished by innovation and analyzing your competitor's weaknesses. Force innovation.\n\n### Marketing\n\nIf you have an OK product (a weak knight), poor customer service (drunk bishops), and incompetent people (a castle full of idiots), you can survive with a powerful queen.\n\nBusinesses survive. Brands thrive. A brand is the best defense to commoditization.\n\nThe first step at building a brand is to have a Unique Selling Proposition or a USP. Your USP is the anchor to your brand. What makes your company different from the rest? What sets your business apart? What will compel a customer to use you over someone else?\n\nStep 1: Uncover the Benefit(s) \nGet into business for the right reason: to solve a problem or a need. That creates your first USP.\n\nStep 2: Be Unique \nThe objective of a USP is to be unique when compared to the alternatives. USPs should use powerful action verbs that create desire and urgency.\n\nStep 3: Be Specific and Give Evidence \nNoise is everywhere, and if you are going to rise above it, you have to alleviate natural consumer skepticism. Do so by being specific, and if possible, offer evidence.\n\nStep 4: Keep it Short, Clear, and Concise \n\nStep 5: Integrate Your USP into ALL Marketing Materials \n\nInclude your USP on all your public communications:\n- Your trucks, vehicles, and buildings\n- Your advertising and promotional materials\n- Business cards, letterheads, signs, brochures, and flyers\n- Your Web site and your email signature\n- Your voice mail system, receptionist/sales scripts, etc.\n  \n  Step 6: Make it real\n  \n  There are five ways to get your message above the noise:\n  1. Polarize: Polarization probably isn't the best business strategy for a mass-market brand. However, polarization works fabulously for Websites in need of traffic or books in need of readers.\n  2. Arouse emotions: If you can move your audience's emotions and make them care, they will buy. Exhilarate people, make them cry and make them laugh. Your message will rise from the ashes of noise and compel people to buy.\n  3. Be risqué\n  4. Encourage interaction and\n  5. Be unconventional: If you get someone's attention, half the battle is won. The other half is letting selfishness take over your audience and tailor your messages to self-interest. In other words, the good old “What's in it for me?” How about saving 15% or more on your car insurance?\n  \n  We must become problem solvers, and to identify our business as a savior to someone, we must translate features into benefits.\n- Switch places.\n- Identify features.\n- Identify advantages.\n- Translate advantages into benefits.\n  \n  Price is a brand-builder because price implies value. The more expensive your price, the higher its perceived value.\n  \n  Unless price is your brand (Wal-Mart, Southwest Airlines), don't let price steal your brand when it should be defining it. Price is more than just a competitive metric that slides up and down to sell goods faster. It also indirectly conveys the value of your product or service.\n\n### MONOGAMY OVER POLYGAMY\n\nThe Tekel Syndrome is a compulsion to scatter your focus across different projects and opportunities. It's also a symptom of money chasing versus need filling. When you invest your time into five different businesses, you become a polygamist-opportunist.\n\n*A scattered focus leads to scattered results.*\n\nWhen you segregate your effort among assets, you build weak assets.\n\nI don't know any highly successful polygamist-opportunists unless they were monogamous first.\n\nFocus on one thing and do it in the most excellent way. \n\nAfter successful entrepreneurs hit the mother lode of wealth, then, and only then, do they divert into other ventures that deviate from their core business. In other words,** their monogamy led to polygamy**.\n\nFocus on one Fastlane business and kick ass at it.","lastmodified":"2023-07-12T02:09:05.416035271Z","tags":["Book"]},"/notes/Transformer-Model":{"title":"Transformer Model","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-12T02:09:05.416035271Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Understanding-OAuth2-and-OpenID-Connect":{"title":"Understanding OAuth2 and OpenID Connect","content":"\n# OAuth2\n\nOAuth2[^1] is an open standard for users to give one application permission to access their information in another application. The steps to grant permission, or _consent_, are often referred to as _authorization_ or _delegated authorization_. \n\nThe below diagram [^2] describes the user flow of OAuth2 Authorization Code Grant[^3]. It's important to note that the **Client** and the **Authorization Server** have already established a working relationship by sharing the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** (generated by the **Authorization Server**). The handshakes to exchange **authorization code** and **access token** happens between the **Client** and **Authorization Server**. The **Resource Owner** participates the first half of the flow with the **Authorization Server** to perform the authentication and consent.\n\n![OAuth Flow](assets/oauth2-flow.png) \n# OpenID Connect\n\nOAuth2 is designed only for _authorization_, OpenID Connect (OIDC)[^4] builds on top of OAuth2 for _authentication_, i.e. establishing a login session. OIDC enables scenarios where one login can be used across multiple applications, known as *single sign-on (SSO)*.\n\nThe OpenID Connect flow looks the same as OAuth. The only differences are, in the initial request, a specific scope of `openid` is used, and in the final exchange the **Client** receives both an **Access Token** and an **ID Token**.\n\nAn **ID Token** is a specifically formatted string of characters known as a JSON Web Token, or JWT. JWTs are sometimes pronounced “jots.” The **Client** can extract information embedded in the JWT such as your ID, name, when you logged in, the **ID Token** expiration, and if anything has tried to tamper with the JWT. The data inside the **ID Token** are called _claims_.\n\nHow SSO works with OIDC is implementation specific, but typically when you login at the authorization server, you receive a login session cookie with the server that is used to give you the SSO experience[^5].\n\n![OIDC Flow](assets/oidc-flow.png)\n\n# Terminology\n\n| Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Authentication       | Establishing a login session                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Authorization        | Grant permission, or consent                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Identity             | The information about the person logged in, i.e. the **Resource Owner**.                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Identity Provider    | An **Authorization Server** that supports OIDC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Resource Owner       | You!

After mucking around for an afternoon, I have established some basic rules.\n\nI decided not to use tags extensively: Obsidian uses spaces to separate tags, while quarts renders a tag in a space-separated first-word-capitalized sequence. This gets confusing and now looking good. I also find that my previous usage of tags is not that helpful to retrieval information, and requires extra efforts to maintain. If you have a well-organized knowledge graph, what extra values that tags can provide you anyway? \n\nTherefore, dropping it seems to be the right move here. As some points, I might adapt [the tagging system used by the author of quarts](https://jzhao.xyz/tags/).
