I still vaguely remember when I first tried to pick up soccer when I was a kid. I can't remember when exactly that was. That was shortly after my family moved from a small town to a third-tier city. At the time, Man Utd was still the best team in Premier league. David Beckham was on every sports newspaper and magazines. So I think I was around 7 or 8.

I probably got a ball and a pair of shoes at some point. I _think_ I got a pair of 回力钉鞋. The neighborhood we lived in actually had many lawns between the apartment buildings. So I was running around with the ball, and started to practice passing and shooting at the wall of a nearby building. At some point, the people in the building got pissed up enough and they wrote on the wall "在此踢球者付款50元". 50 Yuan was crazy amount of money at that time for a kid, so I stopped playing there. The other nearest field was in a nearby school, which took around 10 minutes to get them, and honestly it was just all sand and rocks. There wasn't a field in my school either, we only had concrete court. So I gave up soccer after a quick stint, and turned to Ping Pong.

But I still wore 回力钉鞋, and in fact I think they were the only kind of shoes I wore for most of my elementary school. I started to watch soccer games whenever they are on TV. After a couple of years, the first video game I played was FIFA 98. I ever started to play CM 03/04 in my middle school. There is always some connection between me and soccer, but I've never actually played soccer ever since.

And soccer came back into my life, somewhat surprisingly, when my elder son entered elementary school. He was introduced to soccer at around 4, since that was the only ball sport that he was able to play at the time. I didn't know how to teach, so it was mostly we chasing the ball and then kicking it around. He was relatively interested, especially compared to other sports that we tried to introduce (and he disliked), so we continued to sign him up for some recreational programs but only occasionally.

So it was a surprise to me that he asked me to play some soccer with him after school, right at the multi-sport field across his school. Later I found out that he started to play soccer with other elementary kids during recess. I was at parental leave with my second son at the time, so I did have some free time. That quickly became a daily routine that we played every day after school until it was totally dark. I picked up my first pair of soccer cleats at that time, [Nike Mercurial Vapor 15 Club Turf](Nike%20Mercurial%20Vapor%2015%20Club%20Turf.md), which I made a ton of mistakes.

That lasted for about a bit less than 2 months, until early November, when DST ended. It was getting dark way too early at 4PM so there was no more time for us to play anymore. And honestly, there wasn't anything I could teach him with my skill level at that time (which was pretty much zero). So we sent him to a tryout for a community club.

At the time, we had a new neighbor moving in, and their kid also played soccer, so we referred them into the same club. When the club season started in the following year January, I was told by a parent that there were actually some pickup soccer WeChat groups. My neighbor got interested, joined the group, and asked me if I wanted to go too.

I hesitated a bit, but didn't for too long. I was learning a bunch of new stuffs because of my kids, so I am kind of getting used to it. And also I found it surprisingly pleasant that I somehow picked up soccer again after almost 30 years. So I started to play pickup on every Friday.

The first several months were tough. I was like a bot on the field. I couldn't receive any pass, I couldn't pass, I couldn't dribble. All I could do was running around like a head-less chicken. I also continued to make a bunch of mistakes on my cleats selections ([X Crazyfast.3 Turf](X%20Crazyfast.3%20Turf.md), [New Balance Furon v7 Dispatch TF Wide](New%20Balance%20Furon%20v7%20Dispatch%20TF%20Wide.md)).

But I started to feel much better in the final quarter of 2024. I think I was getting used to be on the field, feeling more relaxed that I could starting to look around on the field. And also I was slowing getting my touches over the course of the year, maybe on the side during my kid's training, or maybe the weekends that I brought my kid for the light-weight drills. The work did pay off even though it was slow. I was also expanding the collection of [My Soccer Cleats](My%20Soccer%20Cleats.md), mostly out of curiosity about the difference of different brands and their tech.

I sometimes joked to my kids and wife that I am jealous of today's kids that play soccer. All the fields around neighborhoods, with lights that they can even play when it was dark, and the formal training sessions multiple times a week. That was like a dream for the 7-year old me. But then, I was grateful to my kids, for bring soccer back to my life.
