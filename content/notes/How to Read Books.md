It turns out that I need to find a more efficient way to read so that I can get through my [Reading list](📚%20Antilibrary.md), and therefore I created this page to collect tips for optimization. It was used to be called "How to Read Fast", but then I realized that speed/volume is not what I should optimize for.

There is another page on

## General

Instead of volume, the goal of reading should be instead comprehension. Therefore, instead of optimizing for speed, a better approach should be actively engaged during the reading[^3]

> What matters is how it changes your thinking and what you take away from it. Optimize for comprehension, not volume.
>
> If your goal is to maximize comprehension, you need to ask questions while you read — questions that you yourself must try to answer in the course of reading.
>
> ...
>
> This is the template I use:
>
> 1. In 1-2 sentences, what is the book about as a whole?>
> 2. What are the 3-4 central questions it tries to answer?
> 3. Summarize the answers in one paragraph each.
> 4. What are the most important things you have learned personally?

Following the above process does mean the reading speed would be slower, and therefore you would need to be more picky on your book selection. It is suggested to use topical reading and inspectional reading to gather a list of books and quickly skim through them before spending more time to read into details. This approach is discussed in [如何阅读一本书](../../notes/如何阅读一本书.md).

## Non-fiction

It turns out that I need to find a more efficient way to read so that I can get through my [Reading list](📚%20Antilibrary.md). Fortunately, I have found some tips for non-fiction[^1]:

> 1. **Start with the author**. Who wrote the book? Read his or her bio. If you can find a brief interview or article online about the author, read that quickly. It will give you a sense of the person’s bias and perspective.
> 2. **Read the title, the subtitle, the front flap, and the table of contents.** What’s the big-picture argument of the book? How is that argument laid out? By now, you could probably describe the main idea of the book to someone who hasn’t read it.
> 3. **Read the introduction and the conclusion.** The author makes their case in the opening and closing argument of the book. Read these two sections word for word but quickly. You already have a general sense of where the author is going, and these sections will tell you how they plan to get there (introduction) and what they hope you got out of it (conclusion).
> 4. **Read/skim each chapter.** Read the title and anywhere from the first few paragraphs to the first few pages of the chapter to figure out how the author is using this chapter and where it fits into the argument of the book. Then skim through the headings and subheadings (if there are any) to get a feel for the flow. Read the first sentence of each paragraph and the last. If you get the meaning, move on. Otherwise, you may want to read the whole paragraph. Once you’ve gotten an understanding of the chapter, you may be able to skim over whole pages, as the argument may be clear to you and also may repeat itself.
> 5. **End with the table of contents again.** Once you’ve finished the book, return to the table of contents and summarize it in your head. Take a few moments to relive the flow of the book, the arguments you considered, the stories you remember, the journey you went on with the author.

The idea is that most of the non-fiction books is to make a point and ask us to learn from it. Therefore, you don't have to read word-for-word, but instead just need to _understand_ them.

Though it sounds like for fiction books, we should still read word-for-word.

### Three Kinds of Non-fiction

The tips can be further developed to group non-fiction into three categories[^2]:

- 💁‍♀️ narrative: books that tell a story, e.g. biographies, memoirs, and histories.
- 🌳 tree: books that lay out a framework of ideas, e.g. Daniel Kahneman's *[Thinking: Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555)*, *[High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884)* by Andy Grove, and *[Principles](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio/dp/1501124021)* by Ray Dalio.
- 🌿 branch: books that consist of a single idea and padded out with examples, extrapolations, and implications of that single idea, e.g. Nicholas Nassem Taleb's *[Antifragile](https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680)*.

The fore-mentioned tips are best applied to branch books, where you can skim quickly without losing much. The article in fact makes an even stronger claim that it's best to not read branch books at all and instead read a summary.

For the other two types, though, seems like we're out of luck. The article actually suggests going slow on tree books, chapter-by-chapter, to better consume and internalize.
