This site is an attempt to build a [Knowledge Garden](notes/Knowledge%20Garden.md) using [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), where I hope to be structured enough to serve as useful notes while unstructured enough to allow overheads. The content here is written [for me by default](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z8AfCaQJdp852orumhXPxHb3r278FHA9xZN8J), so please expect them to be quite disorganized. I put my slightly more organized contents in [my blog](https://blog.ziyun.rocks/) for the public audience.
