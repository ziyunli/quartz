	- > When you have both a traditional IRA and an employer-sponsored retirement plan, the IRS may limit the amount of your traditional IRA contributions that you can deduct from your taxes.
	- > If a taxpayer participates in an employer-sponsored program, such as a 401(k) or pension program, that individual, filing as a single person, would only be eligible to take the full deduction on a traditional IRA if their modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) was $66,000 or less for 2021 ($68,000 for 2022), or $105,000 or less for 2021 ($109,000 for 2022) if married filing jointly. With MAGIs of $76,000 for singles in 2021 ($78,000 for 2022) and $125,000 for married couples in 2021 ($129,000 for 2022), the IRS allows no deductions. In between, there's a partial deduction.
