Google Tag Manager is a tag management system that lets you configure and instantly deploy tags on your website or mobile app from a web-based interface[^2]. 

What's a tag?

> Tags are segments of code provided by analytics, marketing, and support vendors to help you integrate their products into your websites or mobile apps.
>  
> ...you configure and publish tags and how they fire from within the Tag Manager user interface.[^1]

Three main concepts in GTM:
1. events: user actions
2. tags: 
	1. external calls you want to make at a point of time; 
	2. can include an event param
3. triggers: the conditions when GTM will fire a tag

## Web

In web client scenarios, a tag could be advertising tracking pixels or full analytics SDK’s, which are JavaScript code that are injected to web pages at load time.

It's a browser tool and requires an active browser session where JavaScript is downloaded and executed[^6]. Another way to look at it is that this is basically a JavaScript injector - the Interface is there to configure your tags, then everything is wrapped into a JavaScript function that is inserted into your page and executed by the browser. There is no server-side component that you could push data to[^7].

To use GTM, you push events to the data layer:
```javascript
dataLayer.push({
    'event': 'transaction',
    'something': {
        'superSecret': 42
    }
});
```

GTM will watch for the events and fire the corresponding tags based on the defined triggers. 
## Server-side Tagging (SST)

> [!cite]
> The javascript library (called "Tag Manager web container" in the diagram) is always run on your browser in order to collect your interactions and your personal data, but the execution of the various third-party tracers takes place on the server side[^3].

![how-sst-works](assets/how-sst-works.png)
The server is a JavaScript application that runs in a server environment on Node.js. It's packaged and distributed as a Docker image. It's still recommended to use the client-side GTM to collect data, and then dispatch to the server-side tagging server environment. The server container does have endpoints that you can directly send requests to from our clients. 

The goal of SST is more *control*, for:
1. privacy
2. performance
3. data quality
## Native Mobile

In native mobile client scenarios, GTM for Mobile uses event forwarding via Firebase Analytics to send events to the “tags”. ==Containers for Mobile cannot be shared with containers for Web==.
