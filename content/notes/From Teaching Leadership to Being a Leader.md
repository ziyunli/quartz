> If the market doesn't want to buy your product, it doesn't matter how smart you are or what a great idea, logically, your idea is. All that matters is whether or not someone has a burning problem, a desperate problem that needs to be solved.

企业家往往对自己的idea过于自信，认为自己的产品没有成功只是用户的问题，而没有倾听用户的反馈。
这样的做法，很难带来成功。而相对的，成功的企业往往都不是因为它们最初的idea。
企业家更需要做的是，找出愿意使用你的产品的用户，并想办法为他们创造更多的价值。
当你的产品真正解决了用户最迫切的需求时，才能吸引到更多用户。

> Do to others what you want them to do to you.

这是生活上常用的一个准则，也可以推广到谈判上。

> Put the gun in the other person's hand.

你把主动权交给对方，然后观察对方给你的开价。
如果对方给你开了一个荒唐的高价，你可以知道他的为人，然后避免再与他合作。
如果对方给你开了一个诚实的价格，你可能收获了一个值得信任的合作伙伴，而且避免了很多谈判的烦恼。

> If you can't create a fear of loss, you're never going to close the transaction. And so basically, I have to make you believe that the opportunity is going away. But you have to do it in a courteous way. So you have to be courteously indifferent.

损失带来的痛苦远大于获得带来的喜悦。
大多人并不是因为机会而行动，而更多是因为害怕错过。
如果你不能创造出“fear of loss”，那么你将很难close a deal。
作为卖家，你必须创造出“现在不买就没机会了”的错觉。

> One of the biggest mistakes that entrepreneurs make is thinking that everyone—that once others see what you're doing, of course they're going to drop what they're doing and do what you're doing. It doesn't work that way. Because we all have opinions and we all have egos. Just because someone's doing well doesn't mean that I'm likely to drop what I'm doing and do what they're doing. There's actually a term for this in psychology: cognitive dissonance.

关于产品：

> Always develop for our core target audience, even if it means a lousy solution for other people.

了解你的核心用户，针对他们来设计产品。
与其尝试去做一个完美的产品，不如去做一个对你的核心用户而言完美的产品。
你没有办法，也不应该尝试让所有人都满意。

> I believe that delight is the greatest form of virality. And the way you build delight is by solving a problem's burning need. So if we can do that for 70% of our clients, the 30% might complain about us once, but they're only going to complain about us once. But the 70% who love us are going to keep talking about us. So those are two examples of things that we do in our product, and that we will purposely piss people off with what we do if it serves our core target audience.

Build love. Solve burning needs.
如果你可以给70%的用户做到这样，那即使这意味着激怒剩下的30%用户，也是值得的。

> the CEO is seldom the smartest person in the room, but she usually has the best judgment. And so really think about how can you develop your judgment. Judgment is really decision-making under uncertainty. And it's pattern matching. And so you want to keep growing that pattern matching database and be really, really conscious about it.
