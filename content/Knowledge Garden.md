The site is generated by [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), edited with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and deployed on [GitHub pages](https://ziyunli.github.io/quartz/). Some basic rules I am trying to stick to when organizing my learning and knowledge.

1. Here is to keep track of notes and summaries from books and articles.
2. LLMs (mostly Claude Code, but will experiement with OpenAI Codex and Google Gemini later) will be used to organize the content as well as serve as a personal assistant and information retrieval tool.
