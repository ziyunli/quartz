# Studying Coding Challenges

Interactive study flow for coding interview problems: confirm reading, run a mock session, annotate with callouts, create retro + Anki cards.

## Workflow

```dot
digraph study_flow {
  "Read note" -> "Reading check";
  "Reading check" -> "Suggest reading first" [label="not read yet"];
  "Reading check" -> "Determine mode" [label="has read"];
  "Determine mode" -> "Mock interview" [label="hasn't seen solutions"];
  "Determine mode" -> "Solution study" [label="wants to review solutions"];
  "Mock interview" -> "Scaffold in coding repo";
  "Scaffold in coding repo" -> "Clarifying Qs";
  "Clarifying Qs" -> "Approach discussion";
  "Approach discussion" -> "User codes (TODO(human))";
  "User codes (TODO(human))" -> "Feedback + iteration";
  "Feedback + iteration" -> "Wrap up part" [label="works"];
  "Wrap up part" -> "Next part?" [label="annotate + retro"];
  "Next part?" -> "Clarifying Qs" [label="harder variant"];
  "Next part?" -> "Discussion Qs (if any)";
  "Discussion Qs" -> "Wrap up discussion";
  "Wrap up discussion" -> "Final retro + Anki";
  "Solution study" -> "Walk through + Q&A";
  "Walk through + Q&A" -> "Wrap up part";
}
```

## Phase 0: Reading Check

1. Ask if they've read the **problem** (not solutions)
2. If not: suggest reading first. If yes: ask what's tricky — focuses the session.
3. **Mode:** No solutions seen → Mock interview. Has solutions → Solution study.

## Phase 1a: Mock Interview

Play interviewer. User codes; you facilitate and challenge.

### Setup: Scaffold in Coding Repo

Before the interview starts, set up runnable code in `~/codebase/coding-challenges`:

1. Read the coding-challenges repo's AGENTS.md for conventions (`new.sh`, naming, test structure)
2. Run `./new.sh <snake_name> "<Problem Name>" <difficulty> <topic>` to scaffold files
3. Copy starter code from the problem note into `solutions/<snake_name>.py`, preserving the original method names (e.g., keep `addFile` if the starter code uses camelCase — do not convert to snake_case). Only use Pythonic naming when creating problems from scratch.
4. Write tests that demonstrate the bug/expected behavior:
   - Tests for correct behavior (should pass once fixed)
   - Tests that expose the specific bugs (should fail with buggy starter code)
   - Tests for edge cases, LRU ordering, etc.
5. Run tests to verify baseline: some pass (working parts), some fail (the bugs to fix)

If the coding-challenges repo has a scaffolding skill that handles the problem format, use it instead of manual setup.

### Interview Flow

**Step 1 — Clarifying Questions:** Let user ask. Answer as interviewer with concrete examples. If they skip: "Before you code — what would you ask an interviewer?"

**Step 2 — Approach Discussion:** Ask for data structures, algorithm choice, complexity. Give feedback without giving away the answer.

**Step 3 — User Codes:** Add `TODO(human)` in the solution file's code. Frame with Learn by Doing format (Context / Your Task / Guidance). **Wait for their code.** The TODO comment should be minimal — just the new command signature or a brief note. Do NOT write step-by-step refactoring instructions; an interviewer wouldn't hand you a checklist. **Preserve all method stubs and signatures** — place `TODO(human)` inside the existing structure, never collapse or replace stubs.

**Step 4 — Feedback:** Run tests. Review like an interviewer — correctness, edge cases, complexity. Ask them to fix issues; give hints, not answers. Iterate until tests pass.

**Step 5 — Multi-Part:** After wrapping up the current part, confirm readiness before next part. For each new coding part:

- Add new tests to the existing test file
- **Never rewrite or reformat existing working code** — only add new dispatch cases and TODO comments. Touching the user's code (removing types, changing structure) destroys their work and wastes interview time.
- Verify baseline (new tests fail, old tests still pass)
- Repeat the full cycle (clarify → approach → code → feedback)

Sections marked "for talking only" stay as discussion — don't ask for code.

## Phase 1b: Solution Study

Walk through solution pausing at key decisions. Ask "why this approach?" to test understanding. Discuss alternatives.

## Phase 2: Wrap Up (After Each Part)

Run this after **each coding part** and again after discussion questions — not just at the end.

### 2a: Annotate Problem Note (metadata only)

The problem note stays as a **clean problem spec** — only add metadata callouts:

- AI disclosure after frontmatter: `> [!info] AI-assisted annotations` (once, on first session)
- `> [!info] See also` for alternate versions or related notes

Do NOT add study callouts or user solutions to the problem note. Those go in the mock session doc (2b).

### 2b: Create/Update Mock Session Retro

Create a retro note in the **same folder** as the problem note:

- **Filename:** `<Problem Name> - Mock Session <YYYY-MM-DD>.md`
- **Structure per part:**
  - Time, Finished (Yes/No/Partial), Pattern
  - What went well
  - Where I got stuck (numbered, specific mistakes with what happened)
  - Key insight to remember
  - Would I pass this in an interview? (Yes/Probably/No)
  - Discussion log (clarifying Qs, approach, key decisions)
  - Iteration history (each attempt with what failed and why)
  - Study callouts placed **contextually after the relevant part** they relate to:
    - `[!question]` conceptual Q&A, `[!warning]` gotchas/bugs, `[!info]` context/patterns, `[!example]` worked examples
    - One concept per callout, `==highlights==` for takeaways, no tables inside callouts
- **Discussion questions** get their own section with bullet summaries
- **`## My Solution`** at the end — user's final code for all parts

### 2c: Update Coding Retro Journal

Find the Coding Retro Journal in the Interview Preparation folder. Add an entry following its template format, with a wikilink to the full mock session retro note.

### 2d: Create Anki Cards

Invoke the `accelerated-learning:creating-anki-cards` skill to create flashcards from the session. Cards go in the project's `anki/` directory. Focus on:

- Gotchas and mistakes made during the session
- Key insights and patterns
- Discussion question takeaways (for discussion parts)

Check existing YAML files to avoid duplicates; add to existing file if the topic already has one.

## Phase 3: Discussion Questions

For "talk only" sections in the problem note:

1. Ask each question, let user discuss
2. Push back, probe deeper, ask follow-ups
3. Share insights the user missed
4. After all questions: wrap up with callouts on the problem note, retro entries, and Anki cards

## Phase 4: Quiz (Optional)

3-5 application questions: "What breaks if [change]?" "How would you modify for [constraint]?"

| Callouts in problem note                 | Callouts go in mock session doc, contextually after the relevant part. Problem note stays as clean spec                                                               |

| Missing AI disclosure                    | Always add after frontmatter                                                                                                                                          |
| Summarizing problem back                 | They've read it — jump to engagement                                                                                                                                  |
| No runnable tests                        | Always scaffold in coding repo with failing tests                                                                                                                     |
| Wrapping up only at the end              | Wrap up after each coding part and after discussion                                                                                                                   |
| Skipping retro/Anki                      | Always create retro note, update journal, and create Anki cards                                                                                                       |
| Prescribing design decisions             | Let user choose format/approach; test behavior not implementation                                                                                                     |
| Rewriting user's existing code           | Only add new code (TODOs, dispatch cases, tests). Never rewrite, reformat, or strip types/annotations from working code — it destroys the user's work and wastes time |
| Over-detailed TODO comments              | Keep TODOs minimal: command signature + brief description. Don't write step-by-step refactoring checklists — an interviewer wouldn't hand you one                     |
| Giving away the design in Guidance       | Guidance should mention trade-offs and constraints, not prescribe the exact data structure changes or implementation steps                                            |
| Renaming methods from starter code       | Preserve original naming (camelCase, etc.) from OA/LeetCode starter code — only use Pythonic naming for problems we create ourselves                                  |
| Collapsing method stubs into single TODO | Place `TODO(human)` inside existing stubs — never delete or merge method signatures into one comment. The stubs ARE the scaffolding                                   |
