In other words, <strong>if you don&rsquo;t plan on distributing profits and are focused on building “asset value” over “net profit,” C corporations do the job</strong>.

However, unlike C corporations, which can have limitless owners, S corporations are limited to 100 owners and will have additional filing requirements.</p><a href=#the-limited-liability-corp-llc><h4 id=the-limited-liability-corp-llc><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Limited Liability Corp (LLC)</h4></a><p>An LLC operates just like <strong>a corporation with the benefits of a partnership or a sole proprietorship</strong>. <strong>LLC profit passes through to its owners, called members, and is reflected on their personal income tax.</strong> LLCs are also considered “pass-through” entities because profit passes directly to the owners.

Aloof and blasé kings lose games and don&rsquo;t win races.</p><p><em>The owner of an idea is not he who imagines it, but he who executes it.</em></p><blockquote><p>When I started my Web business, several other companies already had established Web sites. Instead of reasoning, “Someone is already doing it,” I executed better and became the leader in my industry. Was my idea spectacular? No. It was an OK idea, but I executed better than the competition. After my revenue model became successful and copied unmercifully, did my business decline and fail? No, because the idea wasn&rsquo;t the lynchpin to success, it was execution. Competitors who copied my idea didn&rsquo;t possess a powerful king to the wealth game, and that is execution. Chess isn&rsquo;t won by stealing pawns.</p></blockquote><p>Event versus process. Execution takes process: effort, sacrifice, discipline, and persistence. Ideas are just events.</p></li></ul><a href=#execution><h3 id=execution><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Execution</h3></a><p>Anytime I launched a new service or feature at my Web site, it was an experiment to see how the world reacted.</p><p>The ultimate judge-and-jury of ideas is the world and the marketplaces that serve them. If the world likes your offer, they vote by giving you their time, their thoughts, or their money. If they don&rsquo;t like your offer, they withhold their money and look elsewhere. And the reall&mldr;</p><p><em>the world tells you which direction you should be going at all times.</em></p><p>Business plans are useless. Yes, I said it. Business plans are useless because they&rsquo;re ideas jacked-up on steroids.</p><p>If you want investors, get out and execute! Create a prototype! Create a brand! Create a track record that others can see or touch! Dive into process.</p><p>Angels to private equity never invest in business plans-they invest in people with track records of execution.</p><a href=#customer-service><h3 id=customer-service><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Customer Service</h3></a><blockquote><p>If you do build a great experience, customers tell each other about that. Word of mouth is very powerful.</p></blockquote><p>A black book: a written record of all complaints, grievances, and issues my business experienced daily.</p><p>There are four types of complaints:</p><ul><li><p>Complaints of change: Complaints of change are the least informative and therefore are the ones most difficult to decipher. For my redesign failure, data confirmed that the complaints were substantial. Bounce rates tripled and my conversion ratio suffered.</p></li><li><p>Complaints of expectation: Complaints of expectation occur when you negatively violate the expectation of your customer. If I couldn&rsquo;t manage the complaints, I could manage the expectations. I knew if my customers were making money, they&rsquo;d keep paying me. Complaints of expectation expose <strong>operational issues, marketing misinformation, and/or product problems</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Complaints of void: Complaints of void are when your customer continually requests something and you simply don&rsquo;t have it. Complaints of void are extremely valuable, as they expose unmet needs. <strong>Complaints of void are goldmines of opportunity.</strong></p></li><li><p>Complaints of fraud: Fraudulent complaints are the most disheartening because they reflect the worst of society: Illegitimate complaints designed to exploit the business owner. How do you deal with exploitive complainers? You respond once with grace, explain your position, and move on.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody.</p><p>As a business owner you must remember that, while you don&rsquo;t have a boss, the person who pays your mortgage is your customer and they always should be heard-but sometimes ignored.</p><p>While bad customer service is frustrating while playing our consumer role, it gives us entrepreneurs a great opportunity. <strong>Where customer service lacks unearths great opportunity</strong>.</p><p>Customer discipleship grows businesses exponentially because human resource systems talk.</p><p>To provide great customer service and explode your business, determine your customers&rsquo; expectation profile. What are their expectations when they deal with your business? How do they relate to competitors and similar businesses in your industry? Make a subjective call on how your customers expect service. Then VIOLATE IT.</p><p>Any time you violate your customer&rsquo;s expectations to the positive, you get a dual benefit. First, they buy from you again. Second, raving customers become liaisons and disciples for your business and unpaid human resource systems. Both build speed. Speed builds wealth.</p><p>Great customer service costs more to provide, but the benefits should outweigh the costs. If more money were spent on pleasing existing clients rather than trying to find new ones, the average business would survive longer than five years.</p><p>Violate customer&rsquo;s expectations. Create evangelists. Create human resource systems that will work for you, for free. Attract money.</p><p>Success in business comes from making your customer the boss and the No. 1 stakeholder to your business.</p><p>Public companies are the worst offenders, as shareholders come first, Wall Street second, and executives third.</p><p>My repeated, and often preached, motto to my employees was, &ldquo;The customer pays your paycheck, not me-keep them happy&rdquo;.</p><p><em>Look big, act small</em>. My objective was to look like I had the power of a big company, yet give personal service as if I were a one-person operation. If an entrepreneur thinks they can&rsquo;t compete because you&rsquo;re too big and too well funded, you&rsquo;ve won before they&rsquo;ve even started. They either engage half-heartedly or defer to another industry with duller competition. Look big, but act small.</p></li></ul><a href=#people><h3 id=people><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>People</h3></a><p>You must make your trust an asset to be earned by others. Let actions speak louder than words.</p><p><em>Trust, but verify.</em></p><p>There are two critical lessons in this experience:</p><ul><li>A SUCS customer service philosophy must be delivered by your employees.</li><li>Spectacular product features can&rsquo;t overcome poor service.</li></ul><a href=#product><h3 id=product><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Product</h3></a><p>A market is never saturated with a good product ,but it is very quickly saturated with a bad one.</p><p>What is commoditization? Commoditization is a product or service that appears homogeneous among providers. If your product doesn&rsquo;t standout in the crowd, it doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance and you&rsquo;re forced into the strategy of “cutting prices to stand out from the crowd.”</p><p>If your product isn&rsquo;t someone&rsquo;s knight, standing out from the crowd and differentiating, it stands to be commoditized.</p><p>Forget about your competition 95% of the time. The other 5% should be used to exploit their weaknesses and differentiate your business. If you forget about your competition, you&rsquo;re forced to focus on your business, which is to innovate and win over the hearts and minds of your customers.</p><p>If you are going to take your eye off the road and examine your competitors, expose their weaknesses. <strong>Exploited weakness is where brands are built: Differentiation is a defense to commoditization.</strong> What are they doing wrong? What inefficiency is there? Within the gray area of unsatisfied customers lies differentiation. The only alternative to boorish me-too goods and services is differentiation, and that is accomplished by innovation and analyzing your competitor&rsquo;s weaknesses. Force innovation.</p><a href=#marketing><h3 id=marketing><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Marketing</h3></a><p>If you have an OK product (a weak knight), poor customer service (drunk bishops), and incompetent people (a castle full of idiots), you can survive with a powerful queen.</p><p>Businesses survive. Brands thrive. A brand is the best defense to commoditization.</p><p>The first step at building a brand is to have a Unique Selling Proposition or a USP. Your USP is the anchor to your brand. What makes your company different from the rest? What sets your business apart? What will compel a customer to use you over someone else?</p><p>Step 1: Uncover the Benefit(s)
Get into business for the right reason: to solve a problem or a need. That creates your first USP.</p><p>Step 2: Be Unique
The objective of a USP is to be unique when compared to the alternatives. USPs should use powerful action verbs that create desire and urgency.</p><p>Step 3: Be Specific and Give Evidence
Noise is everywhere, and if you are going to rise above it, you have to alleviate natural consumer skepticism. Do so by being specific, and if possible, offer evidence.</p><p>Step 4: Keep it Short, Clear, and Concise</p><p>Step 5: Integrate Your USP into ALL Marketing Materials</p><p>Include your USP on all your public communications:</p><ul><li><p>Your trucks, vehicles, and buildings</p></li><li><p>Your advertising and promotional materials</p></li><li><p>Business cards, letterheads, signs, brochures, and flyers</p></li><li><p>Your Web site and your email signature</p></li><li><p>Your voice mail system, receptionist/sales scripts, etc.</p><p>Step 6: Make it real</p><p>There are five ways to get your message above the noise:</p><ol><li>Polarize: Polarization probably isn&rsquo;t the best business strategy for a mass-market brand. However, polarization works fabulously for Websites in need of traffic or books in need of readers.</li><li>Arouse emotions: If you can move your audience&rsquo;s emotions and make them care, they will buy. Exhilarate people, make them cry and make them laugh. Your message will rise from the ashes of noise and compel people to buy.</li><li>Be risqué</li><li>Encourage interaction and</li><li>Be unconventional: If you get someone&rsquo;s attention, half the battle is won. The other half is letting selfishness take over your audience and tailor your messages to self-interest. In other words, the good old “What&rsquo;s in it for me?” How about saving 15% or more on your car insurance?</li></ol><p>We must become problem solvers, and to identify our business as a savior to someone, we must translate features into benefits.</p></li><li><p>Switch places.</p></li><li><p>Identify features.</p></li><li><p>Identify advantages.</p></li><li><p>Translate advantages into benefits.</p><p>Price is a brand-builder because price implies value. The more expensive your price, the higher its perceived value.</p><p>Unless price is your brand (Wal-Mart, Southwest Airlines), don&rsquo;t let price steal your brand when it should be defining it. Price is more than just a competitive metric that slides up and down to sell goods faster. It also indirectly conveys the value of your product or service.</p></li></ul><a href=#monogamy-over-polygamy><h3 id=monogamy-over-polygamy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>MONOGAMY OVER POLYGAMY</h3></a><p>The Tekel Syndrome is a compulsion to scatter your focus across different projects and opportunities. It&rsquo;s also a symptom of money chasing versus need filling. When you invest your time into five different businesses, you become a polygamist-opportunist.</p><p><em>A scattered focus leads to scattered results.</em></p><p>When you segregate your effort among assets, you build weak assets.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know any highly successful polygamist-opportunists unless they were monogamous first.</p><p>Focus on one thing and do it in the most excellent way.</p><p>After successful entrepreneurs hit the mother lode of wealth, then, and only then, do they divert into other ventures that deviate from their core business.
