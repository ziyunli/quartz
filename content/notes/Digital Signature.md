title: Digital Signature
---

- To create a digital signature scheme, you essentially need three functions:

Generate Keys `publicKey, privateKey = GenerateKeys()`  
- It returns a pair of keys
	- public key: your identity  
	- secret key (sometimes called private key): your secret  
It doesn't take any arguments but just randomness (It has to be *long enough*)

Sign `signature = Sign(privateKey, message)`
- It takes your secret key and your message  
- It returns a signature

Verify `isValid = Verify(publicKey, message, signature)`  
- It takes a public key, a message and a signature  
- It returns a boolean
