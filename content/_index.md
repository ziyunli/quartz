Howdy!

I am Ziyun Li(李子雲), and I also go by Stephen. I am an electrical engineer turned software engineer, and currently working as a ~~Senior~~ **Staff Software Engineer** on  ~~Xbox One at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/)~~ ~~enterprise learning management system at [D2L](https://www.d2l.com/)~~ ~~classroom engagement software at [Top Hat](https://tophat.com/)~~ [API platform](https://docs.instacart.com/connect) at [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/).

Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now), I have a [[now|now]] page that tracks what I've been focused on at the moment.
