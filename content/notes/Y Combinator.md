title: Y Combinator

## Terminology
  
* MFN: Most Favored Nation: giving the company money now but at the terms you will negotiate with other investors later (i.e. at the best valuation possible)
* DPI: distributed to paid in capital ratio; **DPI = Cumulative Distributions / Paid-In Capital**
* RVPI: residual value to paid-in capital; **RVPI = Residual Value / Paid-In Capital)**
* TVPI: total value to paid-in; ***TVPI = DPI + RVPI***
* IRR: internal rate of return

The Y Combinator deal[^1]: 
> The $125k safe and the MFN safe will each convert into preferred shares when your company raises money by selling preferred shares in a priced equity round, which we refer to below as the “Safe Conversion Financing” (this will typically be your “Series A” or “Series Seed” financing, whichever happens first).

> My napkin calculations estimate [@ycombinator](https://twitter.com/ycombinator)'s DPI (distributed to paid in capital ratio) for their 2005 - 2013 vintages at ~320x.[^2]
