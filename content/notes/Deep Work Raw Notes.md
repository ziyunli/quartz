## Work Deeply
Willpower is finite. Add *routines* and *rituals* to your working life to minimize willpower cost and distraction.

### Philosophies

#### Monastic

- ​**What**​: eliminating or radically minimize shallow obligations.
- **When**​: your contribution to the world is discrete, clear and individual.

#### Bimodal
​
- **What**​: divide your time and dedicate some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits

> ...people will usually respect your right to become inaccessible if these periods are *well defined* and ​*well advertised*​, and outside these stretches, you’re once again easy to find.

#### Rhythmic
- ​**What**​: transforms deep work sessions into a *simple* regular habit.
- **Why**​: removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you're going to go deep. Make you disciple to work on projects that don't have hard deadline.
- **How**​: a simple scheduling heuristic (do the work everyday) with an easy way to remind yourself to do the work (red X's on calendar as visual indicator; a set starting time every day).

### Journalistic
- ​**What**​: fit deep work into wherever you can into your schedule.
- **How**​: create a plan ahead of time about how you're gonna enter/implement your deep work, which eventually make it easier to dive in whenever you have a chance.

### Ritualize

Build ritual with strictness and idiosyncrasy:
- Where you'll work and how long
	- Radical change to your environment
	- A significant investment of effort or money
- How you'll work once you start to work
	- Forbids Internet access
	- Maintain a metric
- How you'll support your work
	- Coffee, food
	- Light exercises

### Don't work alone

> This combination of soundproofed offices connected to large common areas yields a hub-and-spoke architecture of innovation in which both serendipitous encounter and isolated deep thinking are supported.

> ...Expose yourself to ideas in hubs on a regular basis, but maintain a spoke in which to work deeply on what you encounter.

### Execution

#### Focus on the wildly important

#### Act on the lead measures

Lag measures describe the thing you're ultimately trying to improve. However, they come too late to change your behaviour.

Lead measures measure the new behaviours that will drive success on the lag measures. For individual work, ​*time spent in a state of deep work dedicated towards your wildly important goal*​.

#### Keep a compelling scoreboard

A scoreboard creates a sense of competition that drives people to focus on the (lead) measures.

#### Create a cadence of accountability

> ...the team members must confront their scoreboard, commit to specific actions to help improve the score before the next meeting, and describe what happened with the commitments they made at the last meeting.

For individual, it can be done as a habit of a weekly review in which you make a plan for the workweek ahead.

### Be Lazy

Disconnected from work at the end of the workday helps to recharge and focus on things outside of work.

## Embrace Boredom

### Take breaks from Focus

...and don't take breaks from distraction.

#### Schedule Internet usage in advance

#### Work like Teddy Roosevelt with great intensity

Give your brain practice with intensity, but also giving it time to rest in between.
Always keep your self-imposed deadlines right at the edge of feasibility.

#### Productive Meditation
1. Be wary of distractions and looping (on what you already know about it)
2. Structure your deep thinking (review *variables* -> define *specific* next-step question -> review the answer you identified)

### Memorize a Deck of Cards
- You begin by cementing in your mind the mental image of walking through five rooms in your home.
- Once you can easily recall this mental walkthrough of a well-known location, fix in your mind a collection of ten items in each of these rooms.
- Combined this is only fifty items, so add two more items, perhaps in your backyard, to get to the full fifty-two items you’ll later need when connecting these images to all the cards in a standard deck.
- Associate a memorable person or thing with each of the fifty-two possible cards.
- As you encounter each item, look at the next card from the shuffled deck, and imagine the corresponding memorable person or thing doing something memorable near that item. For example.

## Quit Social Media
> The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection: You’re justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, or anything you might possibly miss out on if you don’t use it.

> The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.

### Apply the Law of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits
1. Identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and your personal life.
2. List for each the two or three most important (specific enough to act, but general enough that are not tied to a onetime outcome) activities that help you satisfy the goal.
3. Consider the network tools you’re currently use. Go through the key activities and ask whether the use of the tool has a ​*substantially positive*​, ​*substantially negative*​, or *little impact* on your regular and successful participation in the activity.

> The Law of the Vital Few \* : In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes.

### Quit Social Media

### Don’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself

Figure out in advance what you’re going to do with your evenings and weekends before they begin.

> Structured hobbies provide good fodder for these hours, as they generate specific actions with specific goals to fill your time.

## Drain the Shallows
> Very few people work even 8 hours a day. You’re lucky if you get a few good hours in between all the meetings, interruptions, web surfing, office politics, and personal business that permeate the typical workday.

Treat shallow work with suspicion. Keep it confined to a point where it doesn’t impede your ability to take full advantage of the deeper efforts.

### Schedule Every Minute of Your Day
Maintain a thoughtful say in what you’re doing with your time going forward.

### Quantify the Depth of Every Activity
> Shallow Work: Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

> How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?

### Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget

> What percentage of my time should be spent on shallow work?

### Finish Your Work by Five Thirty
- Set drastic quotas on the major sources of shallow endeavours in her academic life.
- Avoid providing enough specificity about the excuse that the requester has the opportunity to defuse it.

### Become Hard to Reach

#### Make People Who Send you E-mail Do More Work

#### Do More Work When You Send or Reply to E-mails

> What is the project represented by this message, and what is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this project to a successful conclusion?

#### Don’t Respond

> When it comes to e-mail, they believed, it’s the sender’s responsibility to convince the receiver that a reply is worthwhile.
