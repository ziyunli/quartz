**If you want to keep getting what you're getting, keep doing what you're doing.**

> Normal is not something to aspire to, it's something to get away from. ~Jodie Foster

- “Get Rich Slow” demands a long life of gainful employment.
- “Get Rich Slow” is a losing game because it is codependent on Wall Street an anchored by your time.
- The real golden years of life are when you're young, sentient, and vibrant.
  
  Wealth eludes most people because they are preoccupied with events while disregarding process. **Without process, there is no event.**
  
  Expect a price to be paid. Expect risk and sacrifice. Expect bumps in the road. When you hit the first pothole (and yes, it will happen) know that you are forging the process of your unfolding story. **The Fastlane process demands sacrifices that few make, to resolve to live like few can.**
- Wealth is a formula, not an ingredient.
- Process makes millionaires. Events are by-products of process.
- To seek a “wealth chauffeur” is to seek a surrogate for process. Process cannot be outsourced, because process dawns wisdom, personal growth, strength, and events.
  
   > If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there. ~ Lewis Carroll
  
  Wealth is not authored by material possessions, money, or “stuff,” but by what I call the three fundamental “F's”…
- Family (relationships)
- Fitness (health)
- Freedom (choice)

## The Fastlane Roadmap

### Fastlane

1.  Controllable Unlimited Leverage (CUL): whereas the Slowlane is defined by uncontrollable variables with no leverage, the Fastlane exploits the opposite conditions: maximum control and leverage.
2. Business: your own business, self-employment, and entrepreneurship are centrist to the Fastlane, much like a job is to the Slowlane.
3. Lifestyle: the Fastlane is a lifestyle choice: a commitment of blended beliefs, processes, and actions.
4. Rapid Wealth Creation: the Fastlane is about creating large sums of wealth rapidly and beyond the confines of “middle class.”

### The Fastlane Mindposts

**Debt Perception:**  
Debt is useful if it allows me to build and grow my system.

**Time Perception:**  
Time is the most important asset I have, far exceeding money.

**Education Perception:**  
The moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing. Constant expansion of my knowledge and awareness is critical to my journey.

**Money Perception:**  
Money is everywhere, and it's extremely abundant. Money is a reflection of how many lives I've touched. Money reflects the value I've created.

**Primary Income Source:**  
I earn income via my business systems and investments.

**Primary Wealth Accelerator:**  
I make something from nothing. I give birth to assets and make them valuable to the marketplace. Other times, I take existing assets and add value to them.

**Wealth Perception:**  
Build business systems for cash flow and asset valuation.

**Wealth Equation:**  
Wealth = Net Profit + Asset Value

**Strategy:**  
The more I help, the richer I become in time, money, and personal fulfillment.

**Destination:**  
Lifetime passive income, either through business or investments.

**Responsibility % Control:**  
Life is what I make it. My financial plan is entirely my responsibility, and I choose how I react to my circumstances.

**Life Perception:**  
My dreams are worth pursuing, no matter how outlandish, and I understand that it will take money to make some of those dreams real.

### The Fastlane Is a Business System: The Slowlane Is a Job

The Slowlane is a job: your hard work traded for your employer's cash.

### Be a Producer: Leverage the Business of a System

When you reframe your thinking from majority thinking (consumer) to minority thinking (producer), you effectively switch teams and allegiances. Yes, become a producer first and a consumer second.

To switch teams and become a producer, you need to be an entrepreneur and an innovator. You need to be a visionary and a creator. You need to give birth to a business and offer the world value.
- Producers are indigenous to the Fastlane roadmap.
- Producers are the minority as are the rich, while consumers are the majority as are the poor.
- When you succeed as a producer, you can consume anything you want.
- **Fastlaners are producers, entrepreneurs, innovators, visionaries, and creators**.
- A business does not make a Fastlane-some businesses are jobs in disguise.
- The Fastlane wealth equation is not bound by time and its variables are unlimited and controllable.
  
  > Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go. ~ TS Eliot
  
  Wealth = Net Profit + Asset Value
  Net Profit = (Units Sold) X (Unit Profit)
  Asset Value = (Net Profit) X (Industry Multiplier
  
  **The valuation of your company is predicated on the subjective PE for your particular industry.**
  
  Stocks trading on the public markets define the multiplier for each respective company by the price-to-earnings ratio, or PE. If a company's stock trades at 10 times PE, investors are purchasing that company at a multiple of 10 times.
- The key to the Fastlane wealth equation is to have a high speed limit, or an unlimited range of values for units sold. This creates leverage. The market for your product or service determines your upper limit.
- The higher your speed limit, the higher your income potential.
- The primary wealth accelerant for the rich is asset value, defined as appreciable assets created, founded, or bought.
- Wealth creation via asset value is accelerated by each industry's average multiplier. For every dollar in net income realized, the asset value multiplies by a factor of the multiple.
- Your industry of specialization will determine the average multiple that determines your wealth accelerant factor. If the multiple is 3, your WAF is 300%.
- Liquidation events transform appreciated assets (“paper” net worth) into money (“real” net worth) that can be transformed into another passive income stream: a money system.

### The Five Fastlane Business Seedlings
- Rental Systems
	- Real estate,
	- licenses, and
	- patents
- Computer/Software Systems
	- Internet and software businesses
- Content Systems
	- Authoring books,
	- blogging, and
	- magazines
- Distribution Systems
	- Franchising,
	- chaining,
	- network marketing, and
	- television marketing
- Humam Resource Systems
	- Human resource systems can add or subtract to passivity.
	- Human resource systems are the most expensive to manage and implement.
- To divorce yourself from the Slowlane's transactional relationship of “time for money,” you need to become a producer, specifically, a business owner.
- **Business systems break the bond between “your time for money” because they act like surrogate operatives for your time trade.**
- If you have a passive income that exceeds all your needs and lifestyle expenses including taxes, you're retired.
- Retirement can happen at any age.
- The fruit from a money tree is passive income.
- **A Fastlane objective is to create a business system that survives time, exclusive of your time.**
  
  
  **The source of their wealth comes from their business interests, while their liquid cash reserves are tied into fixed-income securities like municipal bonds, treasuries, and other highly liquid and safe investments. The rich aren't using the markets to create wealth; they're increasing their existing wealth with leveraged business assets. **
  
  the compound interest weapon is most effective with large sums of money.
  
  The point of this illustration is to show that the rich aren't using compound interest to get wealthy; they're using it for income and liquidity.
  
  As for earning your $10 million, that solution lies in exponential leveraged growth stemming from a Fastlane business-net income plus asset value-NOT in expenses, NOT in the stock market, and NOT in a job.
- **Fastlaners (the rich) don't use compound interest or the markets to get wealthy but to create income and preserve liquidity.**
- **Fastlaners eventually become net lenders**: people pay you to use YOUR MONEY in the form of interest or ownership.

###  The Law of Effection
The Law of Effection states that **the more lives you affect in an entity you control, in scale and/or magnitude, the richer you will become. **

**To exploit the Law of Effection, your business needs to make an impact of either scale or magnitude, or both.** Within our Fastlane wealth equation, “scale” and “magnitude” are implicit to our “net profit” variable.

> NET PROFIT = Units Sold (Scale) X Unit Profit (Magnitude)

Retrace the source of millionaire money and you will find millions of something.

Effection of scale or magnitude always precedes money, either directly or indirectly. The more lives you impact, directly or indirectly, the more wealth you will attract.

The closer you get to the source of large numbers, the closer you will get to wealth. To serve millions is to make millions. Think big to earn big.

### To Pay Yourself First, You Must Own Yourself

The best business structures for your Fastlane business are:
- C corporation
- S corporation
- Limited liability corporation
  
  Each has its advantages and disadvantages, but all share two common benefits: **limitation of liability and tax efficiency**.

#### The C Corporation

The C corporation is a business structure that survives time and can be easily transferred. **Corporate profits are taxed at corporate income tax rates, with net income distributed to shareholders.**

Some C-corp owners use this structure to deploy a strategy known as “income splitting.” The strategy is to partition the business's income to both the owner and the business, effectively lowering the tax bracket of the two, versus a large income for just one.

While C corporations and their owners are subject to double taxation (tax on corporate profits and dividends to shareholders), they are advantageous for larger corporations and corporations with an “asset growth” strategy. In other words, **if you don't plan on distributing profits and are focused on building “asset value” over “net profit,” C corporations do the job**. The majority of publicly traded companies are C corps that do not distribute dividends to their shareholders. They grow revenue and asset value.

#### The S Corporation

An S corporation is like a C corporation except that it isn't taxed as a separate entity. **Considered a “pass-through” entity, taxes aren't paid at the corporate level, but at the individual level and reflected on the owner's personal tax return.** S corporations also have some tax advantages because profits are not subject to the hefty self-employment tax that comes with sole proprietorships. However, unlike C corporations, which can have limitless owners, S corporations are limited to 100 owners and will have additional filing requirements.

#### The Limited Liability Corp (LLC)

An LLC operates just like **a corporation with the benefits of a partnership or a sole proprietorship**. **LLC profit passes through to its owners, called members, and is reflected on their personal income tax.** LLCs are also considered “pass-through” entities because profit passes directly to the owners. For partnerships, the LLC or the S corp is the recommended structure in lieu of a general partnership, which, again, does not offer liability protection.

For small startups, I recommend either an LLC or an S corp. Stay away from partnerships and sole-proprietorships, as they do not limit liability.

Selecting an entity depends on your goals and your vision for your business. Here are some general questions to help you decide.
- What is your exit strategy? Go public? Sell to private investors?
- What is your growth strategy?
- What is your liability exposure in the worst case?
- Do you plan on raising capital now, or in the future?
- Do you plan to hire employees?
- Do you plan to take on new partners?
- Do you plan on earning profits fast? Or not for a while?
  
  **If you aren't where you want to be, the problem is your choices. Your circumstances are the symptoms of those choices.**

### Worse Case Consequence Analysis (WCCA)

WCCA asks you to answer three questions about every decision of consequence:
- What is the worst-case consequence of this choice?
- What is the probability of this outcome?
- Is this an acceptable risk?
- ## The Weighted Average Decision Matrix (WADM)

### Turn Your Back to Farting Headwinds

The more uncanny and exceptional you strive to be, the more you need to fight through social indoctrination. Extraordinary wealth will require you to have extraordinary beliefs.

Join entrepreneur clubs, attend networking events, ally yourself with like-minders, get yourself around people who subscribe to a Fastlane, anything is-possible mindset, and decide who you want on your team of warriors.

### YOUR PRIMORDIAL FUEL: TIME

> _Time isn't a commodity, something you pass around like a cake. Time is the substance of life. When anyone asks you to give your time, they're really asking for a chunk of your life._  ~Antoinette Bosco

Value your time poorly and you will be poor.

“Your money can't save you anymore than it can save me.

The greatest theft of all humanity is to act as if our time on this Earth is infinite when it isn't.

The reality is that time is deathly scarce, while money is richly abundant.

Money buys free time and eliminates indentured time.

Indentured time becomes the ransom of your free time.

Any debt that forces you to work is reclassified from free time and shifts it to indentured time.

Fastlaners are frugal with time, while Slowlaners are frugal with money.

### Continuous Education

When you continually inject yourself with new education, new skills, and new competencies, new roads open and things run smoothly. The right education has incredible horsepower.

Fastlane education is to foster growth of the business system.

You learn from engagement, from doing, and from getting out and taking repeated action, more so than from any book or professor.

Your commitment of pursuit, and then the biggie: applying it.

To start your oil recharge, choose a topic that interests you or an area in your life that needs improvement.

Seminars can be great for education, but it has to be the right seminar, which is affordable and given by producers and experienced experts, not by professional, career public speakers.

### Hit the Redline

> If things seem under control, you are just not going fast enough. ~ Mario Andretti

Winners are forged at the Redline. What's the Redline? The Redline is pure, unadulterated commitment.

To get out of first gear, you must make a concerted effort and a lineage of good choices to exploit the power of the Fastlane. There's a profound difference between interest and commitment.

Interest works on your business an hour a day Monday through Friday; commitment works on your business seven days a week whenever time permits.

The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out; the brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. The brick walls are there to stop the people who don't want it badly enough. They are there to stop the othe...

Timing is rarely perfect. Waiting empowers mediocrity. People sit around waiting their entire lives for the perfect this, the perfect that. The perfect scenarios and circumstances never arrive. What does arrive? Time, old age, and the specter of a dream lost.
- **Interest is first gear. Commitment is the Redline.**
- **Hard work and commitment separates the winners from the losers**.
- Some choose short-term mediocre comfort over long-term meteoric comfort.
- **To live unlike everyone else, you have to do what everyone else won't**.
- Arm your expectations to hard work, sacrifice, and other bumps in the road. These are the land mines where the weak are removed from the road and sent back to the land of “most people.”
- Failure is natural to success. Expect it and learn from it.
- One home run could set you financially secure for your life, perhaps generations.
- Home runs can't be hit in the dug out.
- Moronic risks have unlimited downside (long term) and limited upside (short term).
- Intelligent risks have unlimited upside (long term) and limited downside (short term.)
- **There is never perfect timing and waiting for “someday” just wastes time**.
## The Roads to Wealth

If you're a Fastlaner, your road is a business: Internet entrepreneur, real estate investor, author, or inventor.

In the Fastlane, you engineer a business that touches millions of lives in scale, or many lives of magnitude. If your road doesn't lead through Effection's neighborhood or have an off-ramp onto it, sorry, you're on the wrong road.

To light the Law of Effection and illuminate your Fastlane road, cross-examine it against the Five Fastlane Commandments (NECST, pronounced “next”).
1. The Commandment of Need
2. The Commandment of Entry
3. The Commandment of Control
4. The Commandment of Scale
5. The Commandment of Time

The best roads and the purest Fastlanes satisfy the Five Fastlane Commandments: Need, Entry, Control, Scale, and Time.

### The Commandment of Need

**Businesses that solve needs win. Businesses that provide value win.**

Reflect back to our producer/consumer dichotomy. Consumers are selfish. They demand to know is “what's in it for me!” To succeed as a producer, surrender your own selfishness and address the selfishness of others.

Stop thinking about business in terms of your selfish desires. Instead, **chase needs, problems, pain points, service deficiencies, and emotions.**

You and your business attract money when you stop being selfish and turn your business's focus from the needs of yourself to the needs of other people. Give first, take second. Needs come first, not money! Needs precede money!
- Is there a *need* in my neighborhood for a martial arts studio?
- What are existing martial arts studios doing wrong that I *could do better*?
- What improved *value* do I offer the martial arts student?
- What *assets* do I bring to this community?
  
  Money chasers are consumers who haven't quite made the transition to producer. They want to be producers, but they selfishly think like consumers.
  
  Want to make big bucks? Then *start attracting money instead of chasing it*. 
  
  Money isn't attracted to selfish people. It is attracted to businesses that solve problems. It's attracted to people who fill needs and add value. Solve needs massively and money massively attracts.
  
  The amount of money in your life is merely a reflection to the amount of value you have given to others.
  
  The motivational fuel for the Fastlane is passion, not love. Passion gets you out of the garage and onto the road. If you have a passion for a specific goal, you'll do anything for it. 
  
  Passion beats “do what you love,” because passion fuels motivation for something greater than yourself and is generalized. Passion comes from either excitement or discontent.
- Ninety percent of all new businesses fail because they are based on selfish internal needs, not external market needs.
- No one cares about your selfish desires for dreams or money; people only want to know what your business can do for them.
- Chase money and it will elude you. However, if you ignore it and focus on what attracts money, you will draw it to yourself.

### The Commandment of Need

The Commandment of Entry states that *as entry barriers to any business road fall, or lessen, the effectiveness of that road declines while competition in that field subsequently strengthens*.

 If you violate the Commandment of Entry, be prepared to be exceptional. Exceptionality breaks the odds of entry.

Lack of entry itself creates the marketplace, and to succeed in that marketplace, you have to be exceptional.

And if you are exceptional, easy entry becomes not a liability, but an asset.

Want to know if your business violates entry? The answer is another simple question: **as entry barriers to any business road fall, or lessen, the effectiveness of that road declines while competition in that field subsequently strengthens.**.

When it comes to money, the best warning flag is “everyone.” Everyone is a red flag that the Commandment of Entry has been violated. If everyone is engaged in the same activity, it surely will fail.
- The Commandment of Entry states that as entry barriers fall, competition rises and the road weakens.
- Businesses with weak entry often lack control and operate in saturated marketplaces.

### The Commandment of Control

When you control your business, you control everything in your business-*your organization, your products, your pricing, your revenue model, and your operational choices*. If you can't control every aspect of your company, you're not driving! 

 In general:
- Drivers create MLM companies; they don't join them.
- Drivers sell franchises; they don't buy them.
- Drivers offer affiliate programs; they don't join them.
- Drivers run hedge funds; they don't invest in them.
- Drivers sell stock; they don't buy stock.
- Drivers offer drop-shipping; they don't use drop-shipping.
- Drivers offer employment; they don't get employed.
- Drivers accept rents and royalties; they don't pay rents and royalties.
- Drivers sell licenses; they don't buy them.
- Drivers sell IPO shares; they don't buy them.
  
  Build corporate ladders-don't join them. Build pyramid organizations-don't join them. Think manufacture, not retail. 
  
  The real essence of MLM, which is sales, distribution, and training-not entrepreneurship. As a network marketer, you don't own a business-you own a job managing and creating a sales organization.
  
  Stop climbing pyramids and start building them.

### The Commandment of Scale

In business, to be a success you only have to be right once. 

Without leverage, you can't create wealth exponentially. 

To achieve scale, magnitude or reach must increase.

How do you know if your business (or potential business) honors the Commandment of Scale? Ask:
- Can the net income of this business scale limitlessly, say, from $2,000 per month to $200,000?
- Can the asset value of this business scale into the millions?
- Can this business impact millions? Or does it impact hundreds? Is its customer pool the world or a small community in the city?
- Can this business be replicated and expanded beyond the local trading area by franchising, chaining, or additional units?
- Best-case scenario, what is the units-sold potential? One hundred or one hundred million?
- Best-case scenario, how pliable is unit profit? Does it have magnitude?
  
  For the Fastlaner, *the LOE is leveraged by scale or asset value explosion*: Sell millions, help millions, serve millions, impact millions.
  
  There are three barricades that prevent entrepreneurs from realizing the Law of Effection: *Scale, Magnitude, and Source*.
  
  *The Law of Effection honors only those in control.*
  
  If you want access to the Law of Effection, drive a road that can break through scale or magnitude while controlling its source. If you can't be the source, serve the source.
  
  If you are two management positions away from a CFO position at a Fortune 100 Company, you have indirect scale and the law is accessible. Fast wealth is possible.

### The Commandment of Time

Owning a business doesn't guarantee wealth or detachment from time. 

The Commandment of Time asks:
- Can this business be automated and systematized to operate while I'm absent?
- Are my margins thick enough to hire human resource seedlings?
- Can my operation benefit from the introduction of a money tree seedling?
- How can I get this business to operate exclusive of my time?
  
  As a Fastlaner, your road should be traveled with the intention to make it automated. You want passivity and a living money tree. When you fail the commandment of time, the failure is cause by one of two obstacles. They are:
- You don't have access to the seeds because your road started with a deficiency.
- The seeds won't grow in infertile soil.

### Fastlane Purity

Thou shalt not invest in a needless business. Thou shalt not trade time for money. Thou shalt not operate on a limited scale. Thou shalt not relinquish control. Thou shalt not let a business startup be an event over process.
### Internet
- Subscription-based: Offer users access to data, information, or software, and charge a monthly fee. Data can be leads, sales information, a proprietary database, or good old fashioned pornography.
- Content-based: "I consider content-based revenue models the most difficult for success because entry barriers have significantly declined and its success is predicated on high traffic. Also, content systems heavily engage in affiliate programs, which is a hitchhiking structure."
- Lead generation: Lead generation services often provide a service to consumers while simultaneously aggregating a non-homogeneous industry. Lead generation is popular with fragmented industries, where the industry players consist of mostly small to medium-sized businesses. Lead generation solves two needs: 1) The consumer's desire to save time and money and 2) The business owner's need to find new customers inexpensively.
- Social Networks: Social networks are spin-offs of content systems.
- Brokerage Systems: Brokers bring buyers and sellers together and facilitate transactions. They are market-makers for a particular industry and earn money typically on each transaction.
- Advertising: Similar to brokerages, advertisers merge buyers and sellers together and accept advertising fees in lieu of transaction fees.
- E-Commerce: E-commerce is the act of selling goods, services, and information over the Internet.

#### Innovation

Innovation involves two acts: 1) Manufacture and 2) Distribution.

Invent a product, service, or piece of information, manufacture it, and then distribute

the core activity of inventors is just taking something and improving or modifying it.

Innovation is a dual challenged process: manufacture and distribution. Inventing a product that solves a need is half the battle; the other half is getting your invention into the hands of millions, which involves a variety of distribution channels: infomercial (sell via mass media), retail (sell to distributors and wholesalers), and direct marketing (sell via print media, postal mail, Internet).

Distribution is where the war is won. Writing a book is not a business; selling the book is.

#### Intentional Iteration

The process of intentional iteration is the act of satisfying the final commandment, scale. Scale is achieved either through human resource systems or repeated successes.

Iteration is a profitable, singles-based business scaled to home runs.

### Competition

Opportunity is rarely about some blockbuster breakthrough like the light bulb or the car, but as simple as an unmet need, or a need not met adequately. Opportunity is a solution to an inconvenience. Opportunity is simplification. Opportunity is a feeling. Opportunity is comfort. Opportunity is better service. Opportunity is fixing pain. Opportunity is putting weak companies out of business.

You've got a great idea, but someone is already doing it? So what. Do it better.

“Someone is doing it” is a monumental illusion imposing as an impassable obstacle. Someone is always already doing it. The bigger question is, can you do it better? Can you fill the need better, offer greater value, or be a better marketer?

**“Competition is everywhere. Just do it and do it better.”**

DVD rental stores were around for a long time, but that didn't stop NetFlix or RedBox from starting a company and adding “convenience” to the need equation. It was an open road when the road seemed closed.

*Poorly met needs are open roads when they often appear closed.* Successful businesses take existing ideas, services, and products and simply make them better, or spin them in new directions.

How to Spot Open Roads:
- "I hate..."
- "I don't like..."
- "This frustrates me..."
- "Why is this like this?"
- "Do I have to?"
- "I wish there was..."
- "I'm tired of..."
- "This sucks..."
  
  The opportunities of open roads come in easily painted language: **Discomfort, distress, inconvenience, complaints, problems, and performance gaps.** You must attack these challenges and introduce solutions-offer solutions to the masses and I guarantee money will follow! **Moral: Solve other people's problems and you will solve your own money problems!**
  
  Yes, quitting your road and changing directions is sometimes the best choice. But be mindful of the distinction between “quitting” and “quitting your road.” Quitting is leaving your dreams for dead and putting them into the bin of impossibility. “Quitting your road” is changing course and turning down a new road.

### Destination

The tragedy of life doesn't lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach. 

The end of the Fastlane road trip is to crown your happiness with freedom. Freedom from financial encumbrances, freedom to travel, freedom from bosses, alarm clocks, two-hour commutes; freedom from bad ratios (9-to-5, 5-for-2, 2 weeks every 52 weeks and 8% over 40 years) and freedom to enjoy the world as your playground.

Life is not about money, it's about time. 
Money doesn't change people; it just makes them more of what they already are.

Your destination is the lifestyle you desire while having the freedom to enjoy it. There are two strategies to hit your destination. *The first is a money system in which you amass a lump sum large enough to earn monthly interest that will support your lifestyle needs. The second is a business system that spawns passive cash flow that supports your lifestyle AND simultaneously funds your money system.*

What is the price for the freedom and lifestyle you want? Find out with this four-step process:
1. Define the Lifestyle: What do you want?
2. Assess the Cost: How much do your dreams cost?
3. Set the Targets: Set the money system and business income targets.
4. Make It Real: Fund it and open it!

To determine your Net Living Cost by dividing Gross Living Cost by .60, or 60%. This will account for potential taxes.

`Net Living Cost = $14,000 / .60 = $23,333/mo`.

To calculate your money system target, multiply your Net Living Cost by 12, then divide by .05, or 5%.

For your business system target, multiply your Gross Living Cost by 5.

You can't make $5,000 per month until you learn how to make $50 per month! It's amazing how people love to skip process and want events.

Live below your means with the intent to expand your means.

Slowlaners seek to minimize expenses while the Fastlaner seeks to maximize income and asset values.

**A money system isn't used to grow wealth but to grow income. Growing wealth should be left to your Fastlane road.**

## Accelerate Wealth
### The Speed of Success

Planned obsolescence is a marketer's expectation that whatever they're selling you, you won't use it. And if you don't use it, you are unlikely to ask for your money back.

*Doing nothing is expected.*

Speed is not thinking about a Fastlane business, but creating it. Speed is uncovering a need and formulating a solution and a prototype. Speed is filing paperwork for your business entity. Speed is building and growing a business. Speed is making contacts and forcing your process out into the world. Speed is approaching your business like a strategic game of chess while your opponents play checkers. Speed is turning off the Playstation.

How you play each function will determine if you build Fastlane speed or drift aimlessly. Those pieces are:
- The King: Your execution
- The Queen: Your marketing
- The Bishop: Your customer service
- The Knight: Your product
- The Rook: Your people
- The Pawn: Your ideas.
  
  An idea trapped in your brain is like a supercar trapped in the garage with a dead battery. It accomplishes nothing and its purpose is untapped.
  
  If you want to retire 30 years early, you need a dominant, relentless king. Aloof and blasé kings lose games and don't win races.
  
  *The owner of an idea is not he who imagines it, but he who executes it.*
  
  > When I started my Web business, several other companies already had established Web sites. Instead of reasoning, “Someone is already doing it,” I executed better and became the leader in my industry. Was my idea spectacular? No. It was an OK idea, but I executed better than the competition. After my revenue model became successful and copied unmercifully, did my business decline and fail? No, because the idea wasn't the lynchpin to success, it was execution. Competitors who copied my idea didn't possess a powerful king to the wealth game, and that is execution. Chess isn't won by stealing pawns.
  
  Event versus process. Execution takes process: effort, sacrifice, discipline, and persistence. Ideas are just events.

### Execution

Anytime I launched a new service or feature at my Web site, it was an experiment to see how the world reacted.

The ultimate judge-and-jury of ideas is the world and the marketplaces that serve them. If the world likes your offer, they vote by giving you their time, their thoughts, or their money. If they don't like your offer, they withhold their money and look elsewhere. And the reall...

*the world tells you which direction you should be going at all times.*

Business plans are useless. Yes, I said it. Business plans are useless because they're ideas jacked-up on steroids.

If you want investors, get out and execute! Create a prototype! Create a brand! Create a track record that others can see or touch! Dive into process. 

Angels to private equity never invest in business plans-they invest in people with track records of execution.

### Customer Service

> If you do build a great experience, customers tell each other about that. Word of mouth is very powerful. 

A black book: a written record of all complaints, grievances, and issues my business experienced daily.

There are four types of complaints:
- Complaints of change: Complaints of change are the least informative and therefore are the ones most difficult to decipher. For my redesign failure, data confirmed that the complaints were substantial. Bounce rates tripled and my conversion ratio suffered.
- Complaints of expectation: Complaints of expectation occur when you negatively violate the expectation of your customer. If I couldn't manage the complaints, I could manage the expectations. I knew if my customers were making money, they'd keep paying me. Complaints of expectation expose **operational issues, marketing misinformation, and/or product problems**.
- Complaints of void: Complaints of void are when your customer continually requests something and you simply don't have it. Complaints of void are extremely valuable, as they expose unmet needs. **Complaints of void are goldmines of opportunity.**
- Complaints of fraud: Fraudulent complaints are the most disheartening because they reflect the worst of society: Illegitimate complaints designed to exploit the business owner. How do you deal with exploitive complainers? You respond once with grace, explain your position, and move on.
  
  I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody.
  
  As a business owner you must remember that, while you don't have a boss, the person who pays your mortgage is your customer and they always should be heard-but sometimes ignored.
  
  While bad customer service is frustrating while playing our consumer role, it gives us entrepreneurs a great opportunity. **Where customer service lacks unearths great opportunity**.
  
  Customer discipleship grows businesses exponentially because human resource systems talk.
  
  To provide great customer service and explode your business, determine your customers' expectation profile. What are their expectations when they deal with your business? How do they relate to competitors and similar businesses in your industry? Make a subjective call on how your customers expect service. Then VIOLATE IT.
  
  Any time you violate your customer's expectations to the positive, you get a dual benefit. First, they buy from you again. Second, raving customers become liaisons and disciples for your business and unpaid human resource systems. Both build speed. Speed builds wealth.
  
  Great customer service costs more to provide, but the benefits should outweigh the costs. If more money were spent on pleasing existing clients rather than trying to find new ones, the average business would survive longer than five years.
  
  Violate customer's expectations. Create evangelists. Create human resource systems that will work for you, for free. Attract money.
  
  Success in business comes from making your customer the boss and the No. 1 stakeholder to your business.
  
  Public companies are the worst offenders, as shareholders come first, Wall Street second, and executives third.
  
  My repeated, and often preached, motto to my employees was, "The customer pays your paycheck, not me-keep them happy".
  
  *Look big, act small*. My objective was to look like I had the power of a big company, yet give personal service as if I were a one-person operation. If an entrepreneur thinks they can't compete because you're too big and too well funded, you've won before they've even started. They either engage half-heartedly or defer to another industry with duller competition. Look big, but act small.

### People

You must make your trust an asset to be earned by others. Let actions speak louder than words.

*Trust, but verify.*

There are two critical lessons in this experience:
- A SUCS customer service philosophy must be delivered by your employees.
- Spectacular product features can't overcome poor service.

### Product

 A market is never saturated with a good product ,but it is very quickly saturated with a bad one. 

What is commoditization? Commoditization is a product or service that appears homogeneous among providers. If your product doesn't standout in the crowd, it doesn't stand a chance and you're forced into the strategy of “cutting prices to stand out from the crowd.”

If your product isn't someone's knight, standing out from the crowd and differentiating, it stands to be commoditized.

Forget about your competition 95% of the time. The other 5% should be used to exploit their weaknesses and differentiate your business. If you forget about your competition, you're forced to focus on your business, which is to innovate and win over the hearts and minds of your customers.

 If you are going to take your eye off the road and examine your competitors, expose their weaknesses. **Exploited weakness is where brands are built: Differentiation is a defense to commoditization.** What are they doing wrong? What inefficiency is there? Within the gray area of unsatisfied customers lies differentiation. The only alternative to boorish me-too goods and services is differentiation, and that is accomplished by innovation and analyzing your competitor's weaknesses. Force innovation.

### Marketing

If you have an OK product (a weak knight), poor customer service (drunk bishops), and incompetent people (a castle full of idiots), you can survive with a powerful queen.

Businesses survive. Brands thrive. A brand is the best defense to commoditization.

The first step at building a brand is to have a Unique Selling Proposition or a USP. Your USP is the anchor to your brand. What makes your company different from the rest? What sets your business apart? What will compel a customer to use you over someone else?

Step 1: Uncover the Benefit(s) 
Get into business for the right reason: to solve a problem or a need. That creates your first USP.

Step 2: Be Unique 
The objective of a USP is to be unique when compared to the alternatives. USPs should use powerful action verbs that create desire and urgency.

Step 3: Be Specific and Give Evidence 
Noise is everywhere, and if you are going to rise above it, you have to alleviate natural consumer skepticism. Do so by being specific, and if possible, offer evidence.

Step 4: Keep it Short, Clear, and Concise 

Step 5: Integrate Your USP into ALL Marketing Materials 

Include your USP on all your public communications:
- Your trucks, vehicles, and buildings
- Your advertising and promotional materials
- Business cards, letterheads, signs, brochures, and flyers
- Your Web site and your email signature
- Your voice mail system, receptionist/sales scripts, etc.
  
  Step 6: Make it real
  
  There are five ways to get your message above the noise:
  1. Polarize: Polarization probably isn't the best business strategy for a mass-market brand. However, polarization works fabulously for Websites in need of traffic or books in need of readers.
  2. Arouse emotions: If you can move your audience's emotions and make them care, they will buy. Exhilarate people, make them cry and make them laugh. Your message will rise from the ashes of noise and compel people to buy.
  3. Be risqué
  4. Encourage interaction and
  5. Be unconventional: If you get someone's attention, half the battle is won. The other half is letting selfishness take over your audience and tailor your messages to self-interest. In other words, the good old “What's in it for me?” How about saving 15% or more on your car insurance?
  
  We must become problem solvers, and to identify our business as a savior to someone, we must translate features into benefits.
- Switch places.
- Identify features.
- Identify advantages.
- Translate advantages into benefits.
  
  Price is a brand-builder because price implies value. The more expensive your price, the higher its perceived value.
  
  Unless price is your brand (Wal-Mart, Southwest Airlines), don't let price steal your brand when it should be defining it. Price is more than just a competitive metric that slides up and down to sell goods faster. It also indirectly conveys the value of your product or service.

### MONOGAMY OVER POLYGAMY

The Tekel Syndrome is a compulsion to scatter your focus across different projects and opportunities. It's also a symptom of money chasing versus need filling. When you invest your time into five different businesses, you become a polygamist-opportunist.

*A scattered focus leads to scattered results.*

When you segregate your effort among assets, you build weak assets.

I don't know any highly successful polygamist-opportunists unless they were monogamous first.

Focus on one thing and do it in the most excellent way. 

After successful entrepreneurs hit the mother lode of wealth, then, and only then, do they divert into other ventures that deviate from their core business. In other words,** their monogamy led to polygamy**.

Focus on one Fastlane business and kick ass at it.
