[No, Google Did Not Hike the Price of a .dev Domain from $12 to $850](https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/domain_pricing_is_very_confusing) explains how domain pricing works. It's important to understand the difference between registers and registrars.

- Every top-level domain (TLD) is controlled by a register. Registers do not sell domain directly to the public.
- Registrars broker the transaction between a domain registrant and the registry.

The registration fee of a domain usually consists of

1. Registry fee
2. Registrar markup, and
3. ICANN fee.

Usually, registers have an agreement with ICANN that has certain limitations on how much they can charge for the fee. However, country-code TLDs (2-letter TLD) do not have an enforceable registry agreements with ICANN. They are governed by their respective countries (or similar political entities), which have full control on the pricing.--
