Since I started playing [soccer](../../writing/Soccer.md), I’ve gradually built up a collection of football boots. Early on, I made quite a few missteps, which led me to learn more about boot differences—and that’s how my collection began.

| **TF**     | Nike Mercurial Vapor 15 Club Turf       | ★★☆    | [[20230821]]: $59.99 <br>**No Longer Owned**                                                | My first pair when Jasper wanted to play daily. Size 9 was too small, and TF studs are terrible on natural grass. The quality was mediocre, but I have fond memories of them.                         | ![](../assets/nike-mercurial-vapor-15-club-tf.png)    |
| **TF**     | adidas X Crazyfast.3 Turf               | ★★☆    | [[20240111]]: $71.25                                                                        | Size 9.5 is too narrow; the stiff, unpadded upper makes them difficult to put on.                                                                                                                     | ![](../assets/adidas-x-crazyfast-3-tf.png)            |
| **TF**     | New Balance Furon v7 Dispatch TF Wide   | ★★★☆   | [[20240319]]: $32.39                                                                        | My first New Balance boots. The wide fit suits broad feet well, and the padding is comfortable.                                                                                                       | ![](../assets/new-balance-furon-v7-dispatch-tf.png)   |
| **Indoor** | Nike Streetgato                         | ★★★    | [[20240406]]: $74.97                                                                        | My most-worn pair this year. Looks like casual sneakers, but can be slippery on wet surfaces. Overall, a convenient everyday option.                                                                  | ![](../assets/nike-streetgato.png)                    |
| **Indoor** | adidas Copa Gloro (Indoor)              |        | [[20241027]]: $34.48                                                                        | —                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ![](../assets/adidas-copa-gloro-indoor.png)           |
| **FG**     | Lotto Stadio 200 III FG                 | ★★     | [[20241027]]: $19.48                                                                        | Easy to slip on for wide feet, but heel lockdown is poor. The studs—especially at the heel—are long and bulky on AG. The tongue flaps around during play and can’t be removed. Should’ve returned it. | ![](../assets/lotto-stadio-200-iii-fg.png)            |
| **FG**     | New Balance 442 v2 Pro FG Wide          | ★★★★   | ~~[20241209](../journals/20241209.md): $71.78~~ **Returned** <br>[[20241218]]: $62.41 + tax | Comfortable and lightweight, with conical FG studs that handle AG well. Heel lockdown is weak but improves with a runner’s loop. Limited water resistance makes them less ideal in heavy rain.        | ![](../assets/new-balance-442-v2-pro-fg.png)          |
| **FG**     | adidas F50 League Laceless FG/MG        | ★★★    | ~~[[20241129]]: $49.87~~ **Returned**                                                       | Didn’t like the laceless design, and it felt narrow.                                                                                                                                                  | ![](../assets/adidas-f50-league.png)                  |

| **FG**     | Nike Premier III FG                     |        | [[20241224]]: €69.71 + shipping                                                             | A K-leather colorway from Unisports, pricier due to exchange rates and shipping. Looking forward to trying them out.                                                                                  | ![](../assets/nike-premier-3-k-leather.png)           |
| **FG**     | Mizuno Morelia Neo IV Beta Elite FG/AG  |        | [[20241224]]: €129.37 + shipping                                                            | Decided to try Mizuno again after reading positive reviews. Went with EU 43/UK 9, hoping for a better fit.                                                                                            | ![](../assets/mizuno-morelia-neo-4-beta-elite.png)    |
| **FG**     | New Balance Tekela Pro V4+ Low          |        | [20241228](../journals/20241228.md): $88.58 + tax                                           | Returned a second pair of 442s and picked these up instead, having heard great things about them.                                                                                                     | ![](../assets/new-balance-tekela-pro-v4+.png)         |
| **AG**     | Nike Phantom GX Academy                 | ★★★    | [[20240227]]: $55.97                                                                        | My first AG boots. Decently soft and padded for a takedown model, with studs that feel good on AG and hold up well in the rain. Despite the lower price, they’ve really grown on me.                  | ![](../assets/nike-phantom-gx-academy.png)            |
| **AG**     | Mizuno Alpha Elite AG                   | ★★☆    | [[20240916]]: $113.99                                                                       | Ordered size 9.5, which was too small (Mizuno sizes run smaller than Nike/Adidas). Painful for wide feet, and the thin “barefoot” upper isn’t my style. Missed the return window.                     | ![](../assets/mizuno-alpha-elite-ag-mugen-blue.png)   |
| **AG**     | Nike Phantom GX 2 Elite AG              |        | [[20241022]]: $126.79 (Mystery AG $230+)                                                    | Felt like a steal from Soccer.com’s mystery box. I haven’t worn them yet because I’m currently using the Phantom Luna 2 Elites.                                                                       | ![](../assets/nike-phantom-gx-2-elite-ag.png)         |
| **AG**     | Nike Phantom Luna 2 Elite AG            | ★★★★★  | [20241108](../journals/20241108.md): $112.92 (Mystery AG $230+)                             | Initially assumed to be a women’s model, but they’re fantastic—lightweight, great touch, strong heel lockdown, and excellent traction without feeling too aggressive. My current favorite boots.      | ![](../assets/nike-phantom-luna-2-elite-ag.png)       |
| **AG**     | Nike Mercurial Superfly 10 Elite AG-Pro |        | [[20241218]]: $56.01 + tax (Mystery AG $150+)                                               | Expected a Pro-level model but got an Elite. Now I’m hooked on size 10 mystery boxes from Soccer.com.                                                                                                 | ![](../assets/nike-mercurial-superfly10-elite-ag.png) |
