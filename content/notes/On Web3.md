The general thesis from [Why Web3 Matters - a16z crypto](https://future.com/why-web3-matters/):
> ...web1 was decentralized, web2 centralized everything into platforms, and that web3 will decentralize everything again. web3 should give us the richness of web2, but decentralized.

[Moxie Marlinspike \>\> Blog \>\> My first impressions of web3](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html):
Why people want a centralized service?
- People don't want to run their own servers, and never will.
	- Examples: gmail, AWS, etc. 
- A protocol moves much more slowly than a platform. 
	- If something is truly decentralized, it becomes very difficult to change, and often remains stuck in time (see https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/). 
		- (counter) example: ETH upgrade
	- ==A sure recipe for success has been to take a 90's protocol that was stuck in time, centralize it, and iterate quickly.==
		- IRC -> Slack
		- Email -> Facebook (?)
		- XMPP -> WhatsApp

> To make these technologies usable, the space is consolidating around… platforms. Again. People who will run servers for you, and iterate on the new functionality that emerges. Infura, OpenSea, Coinbase, Etherscan.

> Almost all dApps use either Infura or Alchemy in order to interact with the blockchain. In fact, even when you connect a wallet like MetaMask to a dApp, and the dApp interacts with the blockchain via your wallet, MetaMask is just making calls to Infura!
