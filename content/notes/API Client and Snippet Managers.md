## [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

> ...a collaborative platform for developers to help them build, design, test and iterate their APIs.

$5.6B valuation at Aug, 2021, see https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/api-platform-postman-valued-at-5-6-billion-in-225-million-fundraise/. Assuming the valuation takes a 50% discount on 2022, we're looking at around $2.5B to $3B. This is still much better than I originally expected.

## [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/)

I didn't know this company/product before researching into Postman. They are a newer startup and just closed a Series A round in 2021.
