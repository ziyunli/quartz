Ever since I started playing [soccer](../../writing/Soccer.md), I've wondered about the differences between soccer cleats. Of course, I also want a good pair to perform well on the field. But as a beginner, I've made lots of mistakes because soccer cleats can be really confusing. There are different types of studs for different playing surfaces, but you can't easily understand them unless you've tried playing with them—something that's not easy for a beginner. Even experienced players sometimes get confused; I've seen players using TF shoes on slippery AG fields. Because of this confusion, I've ended up collecting many pairs of soccer cleats (not always intentionally). I'm writing down my experiences here to record what I've learned along the way.

One of my biggest confusions in the beginning was choosing the right sole plate. I wanted to avoid injuries, especially knee injuries, so I first picked TF shoes. That turned out to be a big mistake because at the time I was playing with my kid on real grass fields, and those shoes were very slippery. It was fine for casual play with kids, but then I joined pickup games on AG fields. TF shoes worked okay at slow speeds but didn't provide enough traction for quick movements like accelerating or turning.

So, I switched to AG sole plates. The challenge was that not many brands offer shoes specifically made for AG fields. Usually, only Nike and Mizuno consistently have AG models available. Adidas does offer some AG models, but they don't cover their entire product range, and these shoes can be hard to find. Eventually, I discovered that FG shoes also work fine on AG surfaces if the studs are conical and not too long. This discovery allowed me to try many different brands—but then I ran into another problem.

Sizing! Each brand seems to have slightly different sizing, and I’m still confused about my exact foot size. Shopping online makes this even harder. Based on my experience and watching reviews online, here’s my current sizing guide:

1. Adidas - US 9.5: US 10 feels too long. The problem with Adidas is their shoes are usually narrow, making 9.5 hard to put on for many models. I generally avoid Adidas.
2. Nike - US 10: Although sometimes there’s a bit of extra space in the toe box, the overall fit suits my wide feet much better. I might try 9.5 in the future, but for now, grip socks help fill the extra space.
3. New Balance - US 10
4. Mizuno - US 9.5 (275 CM)
5. Athleta - around 270 CM (still unsure)
6. Asics - around 275 CM (still unsure)

| **TF**     | Nike Mercurial Vapor 15 Club Turf     | US 9   | ★★☆    | [[20230821]]: $59.99 <br>**No Longer Owned**                                                 | My first pair when I started playing with my kid after school. Size 9 was too small, and the TF studs didn’t work well on natural grass. They weren’t great overall, but they carry fond memories.                                                                                     | ![](../assets/football_boots/nike-mercurial-vapor-15-club-tf.png)  |
| **TF**     | adidas X Crazyfast.3 Turf             | US 9.5 | ★★☆    | [[20240111]]: $71.25                                                                         | A bit too narrow and hard to put on. The stiff, thin upper lacks padding, and grip was lacking—possibly due to night play on damp AG.                                                                                                                                                  | ![](../assets/football_boots/adidas-x-crazyfast-3-tf.png)          |

The wide fit is great for broad feet, and they have comfortable padding. I learned later that TF boots aren’t the best for AG traction.                                                                                                                    | ![](../assets/football_boots/new-balance-furon-v7-dispatch-tf.png) |

They look casual, so I often wore them to my kid’s training sessions. They can be slippery on wet surfaces, so I’m unsure how they’d do on a proper indoor court. Overall, they’re a convenient everyday option.                                          | ![](../assets/football_boots/nike-streetgato.png)                  |

The tongue also flaps around, and I should’ve returned them.                                                                                                                         | ![](../assets/football_boots/lotto-stadio-200-iii-fg.png)          |
| **FG**     | New Balance 442 v2 Pro FG Wide        | US 10  | ★★★☆   | ~~[20241209](../journals/20241209.md): \$71.78~~ **Returned**<br>[[20241218]]: \$62.41 + tax | Comfortable and lightweight, with conical FG studs that work well on AG. Heel lockdown is weak but improves with grip socks. They have limited water resistance and get very slippery in the rain.                                                                                     | ![](../assets/football_boots/new-balance-442-v2-pro-fg.png)        |

They’re decently soft and padded for a takedown model, with studs that work well on AG and in the rain.                                                                                                                                                             | ![](../assets/football_boots/nike-phantom-gx-academy.png)          |
| **AG**     | Mizuno Alpha Elite AG                 | US 9.5 | ★★★☆   | [[20240916]]: $113.99                                                                        | Felt tight at first, but it’s more about the narrow shape and wearing thick grip socks. The sticky inner lining also makes them harder to put on. Regular socks help, though then I get extra space in my left toe box. They’re slightly narrow for my feet, but perform well once on. | ![](../assets/football_boots/mizuno-alpha-elite-ag-mugen-blue.png) |
| **AG**     | Nike Phantom Luna 2 Elite AG          | US 10  | ★★★★★  | [20241108](../journals/20241108.md): \$112.92 (Mystery AG \$230+)                            | Initially thought to be a women’s model, but they’re fantastic—lightweight, good touch, strong heel lockdown, and excellent traction. There’s extra toe space, so I use grip socks, which also makes them harder to put on, but I love them.                                           | ![](../assets/football_boots/nike-phantom-luna-2-elite-ag.png)     |
