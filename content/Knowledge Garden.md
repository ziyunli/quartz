title: Knowledge Garden
---

This Quartz + Obsidian garden is my catch-all scratchpad for book notes, article highlights, and half-baked thoughts. Everything lands here first so I can find it later without spelunking inboxes.

- Treat notes as a living log: fast summaries, links, or longer reflections when the idea deserves space.
- `notes/` holds blogmarks, quotes, and transcripts
- Write to future me.
- LLMs are used: Claude Code is the default, with Codex and Gemini for experiments.
