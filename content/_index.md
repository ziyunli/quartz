This site is an attempt to [build a knowledge garden](thoughts/build%20a%20knowledge%20garden.md) using [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), where I hope to be structured enough to serve as useful notes while unstructured enough to allow overheads. The content here is written [for me by default](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z8AfCaQJdp852orumhXPxHb3r278FHA9xZN8J), while [my blog](https://blog.ziyun.rocks/) is for the public audience.

Where to start:
- [🚧 now](🚧%20now.md) page, inspired by [`/now`](https://sive.rs/now), that tracks what I've been focused on at the moment.
- [📚 books](📚%20books.md) page that tracks my to-read and read, with links to notes and thoughts.
- [🔖 TILs](/TILs) as a collection of short-form tidbits.
- [📝 notes](/notes) for longer-form notes and write-ups.
- [🏷️ tags](/tags) for a categorized view.
