Howdy!

I am Ziyun Li(李子雲), and I also go by Stephen. I am an electrical engineer turned software engineer, and currently working as a ~~Senior~~ **Staff Software Engineer** on ~~Xbox One at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/)~~ ~~enterprise learning management system at [D2L](https://www.d2l.com/)~~ ~~classroom engagement software at [Top Hat](https://tophat.com/)~~ [API platform](https://docs.instacart.com/connect) at [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/).

This site is an attempt to [build a knowledge garden](notes/build%20a%20knowledge%20garden.md) using [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), where I hope to be structured enough to serve as useful notes while unstructured enough to allow overheads. 

Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now), there is [now](now.md) page that tracks what I've been focused on at the moment.
