# Ziyun's Notes

This used to be a fork of [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz).
However, LFS doesn't work with public fork on Github, therefore I had to create a new repo.

Because this repo uses LFS for `asserts/`, you need to do some extra housekeeping.
When clone the repo for the first time, install LFS and run `git lfs pull`.
