My mental model for Mojo right now is "Typed Python", similar to TypeScript to JavaScript. 
However, even though Mojo uses all of Python's syntax and semantics, but it's not a superset of Python.

Some basic conversions from Python:
1. `def` â†’ `fn`
2. Variables: `var` for mutable, `let` for immutable

Mojo uses ownership, similar to Rust.
